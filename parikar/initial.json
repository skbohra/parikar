जगन्नाथ जी का ही स्वरूप माने जाने \r\nवाले महाकवि जयदेव द्वारा रचित\r\nमहाकाव्य ‘गीत गोविन्द’ की महिमा का वर्णन \r\nकौन कर सकता है ? \r\nजिस पर रीझ कर स्वयं भगवान श्रीकृष्ण ने \r\nअपने हाथ से पद लिख कर उसे पूरा किया । \r\nजयदेव जी और उनकी पत्नी पद्मावती श्रीकृष्ण\r\n प्रेमरस में डूबे रहते थे । \r\nजयदेव जी को भगवान के दशावतारों के प्रत्यक्ष दर्शन हुए थे । \r\nजब भगवान श्रीकृष्ण ने लिखा ‘गीत गोविन्द’ का अन्तिम चरण\r\n\r\nएक दिन भावावेश में जयदेव जी ने देखा कि \r\nयमुना तीर पर कदम्ब \r\nके नीचे भगवान श्रीकृष्ण मुरली\r\nहाथ में लिए मुसकरा रहे हैं ।\r\n तभी उनके मुख से यह गीत निकला\r\n—‘मेधैर्मेदुरमस्वरं वनभुव श्यामास्तमालद्रुमै’ ।\r\n\r\nबस यहीं से ‘गीत गोविन्द’ काव्य का आरम्भ हो गया । \r\nइसमें प्रभु की श्रृंगार रस से पूरित \r\nललित लीलाओं का वर्णन है । \r\nजयदेव जी जब ‘गीत गोविंद’ लिख रहे थे, तब एक बार \r\nउनके मन में श्रीराधिका के मान का प्रसंग आया । \r\nउसमें भगवान श्रीकृष्ण ने अपनी प्रिया \r\nके चरणकमलों को अपने मस्तक का भूषण बता \r\nकर प्रार्थना की कि इन्हें मेरे मस्तक पर \r\nरख दीजिए । इस भाव का पद जयदेव जी के \r\nहृदय में आया पर उसे मुख से कहते हुए तथा \r\nअपनी पत्नी पद्मावती द्वारा ग्रंथ में लिखाते हुए \r\nवे सोच-में पड़ गए कि इस गुप्त रहस्य को कैसे \r\nप्रकट किया जाए ?  इस कारण कविता का अन्तिम \r\nचरण (पंक्ति) पूरा नहीं हो पा रहा था । \r\n\r\nजयदेव जी की पत्नी पद्मावती ने कहा–’\r\nअब स्नान का समय हो गया है, \r\nलिखना बन्द करके आप स्नान कर आएं ।’ \r\n\r\nजयदेव जी ने कहा–’पद्मा ! मैंने एक गीत लिखा है, \r\nपर इसका अन्तिम चरण ठीक नहीं बैठता । मैं क्या करुँ ?’ \r\n\r\nपत्नी ने कहा—‘इसमें घबराने की कौन-सी बात है, \r\nगंगा-स्नान से लौट कर शेष चरण लिख लीजियेगा ।’\r\n\r\nपत्नी के स्नान के लिए जाने पर जोर देने पर वे \r\nगंगा-स्नान को चले गए । कुछ ही मिनटों बाद \r\nजयदेव का वेष धारण कर स्वयं भगवान श्रीकृष्ण \r\nआए और बोले–’पद्मा ! जरा ‘गीत गोविन्द’ देना ।’\r\n\r\nपद्मा ने आश्चर्यचकित होकर कहा–\r\n’आप स्नान करने गए थे न ? बीच से ही कैसे लौट आए ?’ \r\n\r\nमहामायावी किन्तु भक्तवत्सल भगवान \r\nश्रीकृष्ण ने कहा–’रास्ते में ही अन्तिम चरण \r\nयाद आ गया, इसी से लौट आया ।’\r\n\r\nपद्मावती ने कलम और दवात ला दिए । \r\nजयदेव-वेषधारी भगवान ने ‘देहि मे पदपल्लवमुदारम्’ \r\nलिखकर कविता पूरी कर दी । \r\nफिर पद्मावती से जल मंगाकर स्नान किया और \r\nपद्मावती के हाथ का भोजन ग्रहण कर \r\nपलंग पर विश्राम करने लगे ।\r\n\r\nपद्मावती भगवान की पत्तल में \r\nबचा प्रसाद पाने लगी । \r\nइतने में ही गंगा-स्नान करके जयदेव जी लौट आए । \r\nपति को इस प्रकार आते देखकर पद्मावती चौंक गयी । जयदेव भी पत्नी को भोजन करते देखकर आश्चर्यचकित हो गए । \r\n\r\nजयदेव ने पूछा–’पद्मा, आज तुम मुझे भोजन कराए बिना कैसे भोजन कर रही हो ?’\r\n\r\nपद्मावती ने कहा–’यह आप क्या कह रहे हैं ? आप कविता का शेष चरण लिखने के लिए रास्ते से ही लौट आए थे । कविता पूरी करने के बाद अभी तो स्नान-पूजन के बाद भोजन करके आप लेटे थे ।’ \r\n\r\nजयदेव जी ने जाकर देखा, पलंग पर कोई नहीं सो रहा था । वे समझ गए आज अवश्य ही भक्तवत्सल भगवान की कृपा हुई है । फिर उन्होंने भगवान द्वारा लिखा कविता का शेष चरण देखा तो मन-ही-मन कहा–’यही तो मेरे मन में था, पर मैं संकोचवश लिख नहीं रहा था ।’ \r\n\r\nफिर वे दोनों हाथ उठा कर रोते-रोते पुकारने लगे—‘हे कृष्ण ! हे नंदनन्दन ! हे राधाबल्लभ ! हे ब्रजांगमाधव ! हे गोकुलरत्न ! हे करुणासिंधु ! हे गोपाल ! हे प्राणप्रिय ! आज किस अपराध से इस किंकर को त्याग कर केवल पद्मा का मनोरथ पूर्ण किया है ?’\r\n\r\nइतना कहकर जयदेव जी पद्मावती की पत्तल से श्रीहरि का प्रसाद उठाकर खाने लगे । पद्मावती ने उन्हें अपनी जूठन खाने से रोका भी; पर प्रभु प्रसाद के लोभी जयदेव जी ने उसकी एक न सुनी । \r\n\r\nइस घटना के बाद जयदेव जी संकोच छोड़ कर उसी गीत को गाते हुए मस्त घूमा करते और उस गीत को सुनने के लिए नंदनन्दन उनके पीछे-पीछे छिपकर चलते रहते थे ।\r\n\r\nभक्त का प्रेम ईश्वर के लिए महापाश है, जिसमें बंधकर भगवान भक्त के पीछे-पीछे घूमते हैं । इस भगवत्प्रेम में न ऊंच है न नीच, न छोटा है न बड़ा । न मन्दिर है न जंगल । न धूप है न चैन । है तो बस प्रेम की पीड़ा; इसे तो बस भोगने में ही सुख है । यह प्रेम भक्त और भगवान दोनों को समान रूप से तड़पाता है । \r\n\r\nएक बार एक माली की लड़की खेत में बेंगन तोड़ते हुए ‘गीत गोविन्द’ के पांचवे सर्ग की इस अष्टपदी को गा रही थी—\r\n\r\nधीर समीरे यमुना तीरे वसति वने वनमाली ।\r\nगोपीपीनपयोधरमर्दनचञ्चलकरयुगशाली ॥1॥\r\n\r\nउसके मधुर गीत को सुनने के लिए भगवान जगन्नाथ उस लड़की के पीछे-पीछे घूमने लगे । उस समय भगवान ने अत्यंत महीन ढीली पोशाक धारण की हुई थी, जो कांटों में उलझ कर फट गई । लड़की का गाना खत्म होने पर जगन्नाथ जी मंदिर में पधारे तो उनके फटे वस्त्रों को देख कर पुरी का राजा, जो उनके दर्शन के लिए आया था, बड़ा आश्चर्यचकित हुआ । \r\n\r\nराजा ने पुजारियों से पूछा—‘ठाकुरजी के वस्त्र कैसे फट गए ?’\r\n\r\nपुजारियों ने कहा—हमें तो कुछ मालूम नहीं, यह कैसे हुआ ?’\r\n\r\nतब भगवान ने स्वयं सब बात पुजारी को स्वप्न में बता दी । राजा ने भगवान की ‘गीत गोविन्द’ के पदों को सुनने की रुचि जान कर उस बालिका को पालकी भेज कर बुलाया  । उस बालिका ने भगवान के सामने नृत्य करते हुए उसी अष्टपदी को गाकर सुनाया । तब से राजा ने मंदिर में नित्य ‘गीत गोविन्द’ के गायन की व्यवस्था कर दी । साथ ही पुरी में ढिंढोरा पिटवा दिया कि चाहे कोई अमीर हो या गरीब; सभी ‘गीत गोविंद’ की अष्टपदियों का इस भाव से गायन करें कि स्वयं सुगल सरकार श्रीराधाकृष्ण इसे सुन रहे हैं ।\r\n\r\nजगन्नाथपुरी के एक अन्य राजा ने श्रीकृष्ण-लीलाओं की पुस्तक बनवा कर उसका नाम भी ‘गीत गोविन्द’ रख दिया । राजा के चापलूस ब्राह्मण सब जगह यह प्रचार करने लगे कि यही असली ‘गीत गोविन्द’ है । असली पुस्तक का निर्णय करने के लिए दोनों ‘गीत गोविन्द’ की पुस्तकें भगवान जगन्नाथ जी के मंदिर में रख दी गईं । दूसरे दिन जब पट खुले तो भगवान ने राजा की पुस्तक दूर फेंक दी और जयदेव कृत ‘गीत गोविन्द’ की पुस्तक को अपनी छाती से चिपका रखा था । \r\n\r\nयह देख कर राजा समुद्र में डूबने चला । तब भगवान ने आकाशवाणी की कि तुम समुद्र में मत डूबो । तुम्हारी पुस्तक के बारह श्लोक जयगेव कृत ‘गीत गोविन्द’ के बारह सर्गों में लिखे जाएंगे; जिससे तुम्हारी प्रसिद्धि भी संसार में फैल जाएगी ।\r\n\r\nऐसा माना जाता है कि ‘गीत गोविन्द’ की अष्टपदियों का जो कोई नित्य पठन और गान करे, उसकी बुद्धि पवित्र और प्रखर होकर दिन-प्रतिदिन बढ़ती है । साथ ही इन अष्टपदियों का जहां प्रेम से गायन होता है, वहां उन्हें सुनने के लिए श्रीराधाकृष्ण अवश्य विराजते हैं और प्रसन्न होकर कृपा-वृष्टि करते हैं ।", "created_on": "2024-01-31T12:47:22Z",

"description": null, "content": "We've now been doing Y Combinator long enough to have some data about success rates. Our first batch, in the summer of 2005, had eight startups in it. Of those eight, it now looks as if at least four succeeded. Three have been acquired: Reddit was a merger of two, Reddit and Infogami, and a third was acquired that we can't talk about yet. Another from that batch was Loopt, which is doing so well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes if they wanted to.\r\n\r\nSo about half the founders from that first summer, less than two years ago, are now rich, at least by their standards. (One thing you learn when you get rich is that there are many degrees of it.)\r\n\r\nI'm not ready to predict our success rate will stay as high as 50%. That first batch could have been an anomaly. But we should be able to do better than the oft-quoted (and probably made up) standard figure of 10%. I'd feel safe aiming at 25%.\r\n\r\nEven the founders who fail don't seem to have such a bad time. Of those first eight startups, three are now probably dead. In two cases the founders just went on to do other things at the end of the summer. I don't think they were traumatized by the experience. The closest to a traumatic failure was Kiko, whose founders kept working on their startup for a whole year before being squashed by Google Calendar. But they ended up happy. They sold their software on eBay for a quarter of a million dollars. After they paid back their angel investors, they had about a year's salary each. [1] Then they immediately went on to start a new and much more exciting startup, Justin.TV.\r\n\r\nSo here is an even more striking statistic: 0% of that first batch had a terrible experience. They had ups and downs, like every startup, but I don't think any would have traded it for a job in a cubicle. And that statistic is probably not an anomaly. Whatever our long-term success rate ends up being, I think the rate of people who wish they'd gotten a regular job will stay close to 0%.\r\n\r\nThe big mystery to me is: why don't more people start startups? If nearly everyone who does it prefers it to a regular job, and a significant percentage get rich, why doesn't everyone want to do this? A lot of people think we get thousands of applications for each funding cycle. In fact we usually only get several hundred. Why don't more people apply? And while it must seem to anyone watching this world that startups are popping up like crazy, the number is small compared to the number of people with the necessary skills. The great majority of programmers still go straight from college to cubicle, and stay there.\r\n\r\nIt seems like people are not acting in their own interest. What's going on? Well, I can answer that. Because of Y Combinator's position at the very start of the venture funding process, we're probably the world's leading experts on the psychology of people who aren't sure if they want to start a company.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with being unsure. If you're a hacker thinking about starting a startup and hesitating before taking the leap, you're part of a grand tradition. Larry and Sergey seem to have felt the same before they started Google, and so did Jerry and Filo before they started Yahoo. In fact, I'd guess the most successful startups are the ones started by uncertain hackers rather than gung-ho business guys.\r\n\r\nWe have some evidence to support this. Several of the most successful startups we've funded told us later that they only decided to apply at the last moment. Some decided only hours before the deadline.\r\n\r\nThe way to deal with uncertainty is to analyze it into components. Most people who are reluctant to do something have about eight different reasons mixed together in their heads, and don't know themselves which are biggest. Some will be justified and some bogus, but unless you know the relative proportion of each, you don't know whether your overall uncertainty is mostly justified or mostly bogus.\r\n\r\nSo I'm going to list all the components of people's reluctance to start startups, and explain which are real. Then would-be founders can use this as a checklist to examine their own feelings.\r\n\r\nI admit my goal is to increase your self-confidence. But there are two things different here from the usual confidence-building exercise. One is that I'm motivated to be honest. Most people in the confidence-building business have already achieved their goal when you buy the book or pay to attend the seminar where they tell you how great you are. Whereas if I encourage people to start startups who shouldn't, I make my own life worse. If I encourage too many people to apply to Y Combinator, it just means more work for me, because I have to read all the applications.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that's going to be different is my approach. Instead of being positive, I'm going to be negative. Instead of telling you \"come on, you can do it\" I'm going to consider all the reasons you aren't doing it, and show why most (but not all) should be ignored. We'll start with the one everyone's born with.\r\n\r\n1. Too young\r\n\r\nA lot of people think they're too young to start a startup. Many are right. The median age worldwide is about 27, so probably a third of the population can truthfully say they're too young.\r\n\r\nWhat's too young? One of our goals with Y Combinator was to discover the lower bound on the age of startup founders. It always seemed to us that investors were too conservative here—that they wanted to fund professors, when really they should be funding grad students or even undergrads.\r\n\r\nThe main thing we've discovered from pushing the edge of this envelope is not where the edge is, but how fuzzy it is. The outer limit may be as low as 16. We don't look beyond 18 because people younger than that can't legally enter into contracts. But the most successful founder we've funded so far, Sam Altman, was 19 at the time.\r\n\r\nSam Altman, however, is an outlying data point. When he was 19, he seemed like he had a 40 year old inside him. There are other 19 year olds who are 12 inside.\r\n\r\nThere's a reason we have a distinct word \"adult\" for people over a certain age. There is a threshold you cross. It's conventionally fixed at 21, but different people cross it at greatly varying ages. You're old enough to start a startup if you've crossed this threshold, whatever your age.\r\n\r\nHow do you tell? There are a couple tests adults use. I realized these tests existed after meeting Sam Altman, actually. I noticed that I felt like I was talking to someone much older. Afterward I wondered, what am I even measuring? What made him seem older?\r\n\r\nOne test adults use is whether you still have the kid flake reflex. When you're a little kid and you're asked to do something hard, you can cry and say \"I can't do it\" and the adults will probably let you off. As a kid there's a magic button you can press by saying \"I'm just a kid\" that will get you out of most difficult situations. Whereas adults, by definition, are not allowed to flake. They still do, of course, but when they do they're ruthlessly pruned.\r\n\r\nThe other way to tell an adult is by how they react to a challenge. Someone who's not yet an adult will tend to respond to a challenge from an adult in a way that acknowledges their dominance. If an adult says \"that's a stupid idea,\" a kid will either crawl away with his tail between his legs, or rebel. But rebelling presumes inferiority as much as submission. The adult response to \"that's a stupid idea,\" is simply to look the other person in the eye and say \"Really? Why do you think so?\"\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of adults who still react childishly to challenges, of course. What you don't often find are kids who react to challenges like adults. When you do, you've found an adult, whatever their age.\r\n\r\n2. Too inexperienced\r\n\r\nI once wrote that startup founders should be at least 23, and that people should work for another company for a few years before starting their own. I no longer believe that, and what changed my mind is the example of the startups we've funded.\r\n\r\nI still think 23 is a better age than 21. But the best way to get experience if you're 21 is to start a startup. So, paradoxically, if you're too inexperienced to start a startup, what you should do is start one. That's a way more efficient cure for inexperience than a normal job. In fact, getting a normal job may actually make you less able to start a startup, by turning you into a tame animal who thinks he needs an office to work in and a product manager to tell him what software to write.\r\n\r\nWhat really convinced me of this was the Kikos. They started a startup right out of college. Their inexperience caused them to make a lot of mistakes. But by the time we funded their second startup, a year later, they had become extremely formidable. They were certainly not tame animals. And there is no way they'd have grown so much if they'd spent that year working at Microsoft, or even Google. They'd still have been diffident junior programmers.\r\n\r\nSo now I'd advise people to go ahead and start startups right out of college. There's no better time to take risks than when you're young. Sure, you'll probably fail. But even failure will get you to the ultimate goal faster than getting a job.\r\n\r\nIt worries me a bit to be saying this, because in effect we're advising people to educate themselves by failing at our expense, but it's the truth.\r\n\r\n3. Not determined enough\r\n\r\nYou need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder. It's probably the single best predictor of success.\r\n\r\nSome people may not be determined enough to make it. It's hard for me to say for sure, because I'm so determined that I can't imagine what's going on in the heads of people who aren't. But I know they exist.\r\n\r\nMost hackers probably underestimate their determination. I've seen a lot become visibly more determined as they get used to running a startup. I can think of several we've funded who would have been delighted at first to be bought for $2 million, but are now set on world domination.\r\n\r\nHow can you tell if you're determined enough, when Larry and Sergey themselves were unsure at first about starting a company? I'm guessing here, but I'd say the test is whether you're sufficiently driven to work on your own projects. Though they may have been unsure whether they wanted to start a company, it doesn't seem as if Larry and Sergey were meek little research assistants, obediently doing their advisors' bidding. They started projects of their own.\r\n\r\n4. Not smart enough\r\n\r\nYou may need to be moderately smart to succeed as a startup founder. But if you're worried about this, you're probably mistaken. If you're smart enough to worry that you might not be smart enough to start a startup, you probably are.\r\n\r\nAnd in any case, starting a startup just doesn't require that much intelligence. Some startups do. You have to be good at math to write Mathematica. But most companies do more mundane stuff where the decisive factor is effort, not brains. Silicon Valley can warp your perspective on this, because there's a cult of smartness here. People who aren't smart at least try to act that way. But if you think it takes a lot of intelligence to get rich, try spending a couple days in some of the fancier bits of New York or LA.\r\n\r\nIf you don't think you're smart enough to start a startup doing something technically difficult, just write enterprise software. Enterprise software companies aren't technology companies, they're sales companies, and sales depends mostly on effort.\r\n\r\n5. Know nothing about business\r\n\r\nThis is another variable whose coefficient should be zero. You don't need to know anything about business to start a startup. The initial focus should be the product. All you need to know in this phase is how to build things people want. If you succeed, you'll have to think about how to make money from it. But this is so easy you can pick it up on the fly.\r\n\r\nI get a fair amount of flak for telling founders just to make something great and not worry too much about making money. And yet all the empirical evidence points that way: pretty much 100% of startups that make something popular manage to make money from it. And acquirers tell me privately that revenue is not what they buy startups for, but their strategic value. Which means, because they made something people want. Acquirers know the rule holds for them too: if users love you, you can always make money from that somehow, and if they don't, the cleverest business model in the world won't save you.\r\n\r\nSo why do so many people argue with me? I think one reason is that they hate the idea that a bunch of twenty year olds could get rich from building something cool that doesn't make any money. They just don't want that to be possible. But how possible it is doesn't depend on how much they want it to be.\r\n\r\nFor a while it annoyed me to hear myself described as some kind of irresponsible pied piper, leading impressionable young hackers down the road to ruin. But now I realize this kind of controversy is a sign of a good idea.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable truths are the ones most people don't believe. They're like undervalued stocks. If you start with them, you'll have the whole field to yourself. So when you find an idea you know is good but most people disagree with, you should not merely ignore their objections, but push aggressively in that direction. In this case, that means you should seek out ideas that would be popular but seem hard to make money from.\r\n\r\nWe'll bet a seed round you can't make something popular that we can't figure out how to make money from.\r\n\r\n6. No cofounder\r\n\r\nNot having a cofounder is a real problem. A startup is too much for one person to bear. And though we differ from other investors on a lot of questions, we all agree on this. All investors, without exception, are more likely to fund you with a cofounder than without.\r\n\r\nWe've funded two single founders, but in both cases we suggested their first priority should be to find a cofounder. Both did. But we'd have preferred them to have cofounders before they applied. It's not super hard to get a cofounder for a project that's just been funded, and we'd rather have cofounders committed enough to sign up for something super hard.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a cofounder, what should you do? Get one. It's more important than anything else. If there's no one where you live who wants to start a startup with you, move where there are people who do. If no one wants to work with you on your current idea, switch to an idea people want to work on.\r\n\r\nIf you're still in school, you're surrounded by potential cofounders. A few years out it gets harder to find them. Not only do you have a smaller pool to draw from, but most already have jobs, and perhaps even families to support. So if you had friends in college you used to scheme about startups with, stay in touch with them as well as you can. That may help keep the dream alive.\r\n\r\nIt's possible you could meet a cofounder through something like a user's group or a conference. But I wouldn't be too optimistic. You need to work with someone to know whether you want them as a cofounder. [2]\r\n\r\nThe real lesson to draw from this is not how to find a cofounder, but that you should start startups when you're young and there are lots of them around.\r\n\r\n7. No idea\r\n\r\nIn a sense, it's not a problem if you don't have a good idea, because most startups change their idea anyway. In the average Y Combinator startup, I'd guess 70% of the idea is new at the end of the first three months. Sometimes it's 100%.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we're so sure the founders are more important than the initial idea that we're going to try something new this funding cycle. We're going to let people apply with no idea at all. If you want, you can answer the question on the application form that asks what you're going to do with \"We have no idea.\" If you seem really good we'll accept you anyway. We're confident we can sit down with you and cook up some promising project.\r\n\r\nReally this just codifies what we do already. We put little weight on the idea. We ask mainly out of politeness. The kind of question on the application form that we really care about is the one where we ask what cool things you've made. If what you've made is version one of a promising startup, so much the better, but the main thing we care about is whether you're good at making things. Being lead developer of a popular open source project counts almost as much.\r\n\r\nThat solves the problem if you get funded by Y Combinator. What about in the general case? Because in another sense, it is a problem if you don't have an idea. If you start a startup with no idea, what do you do next?\r\n\r\nSo here's the brief recipe for getting startup ideas. Find something that's missing in your own life, and supply that need—no matter how specific to you it seems. Steve Wozniak built himself a computer; who knew so many other people would want them? A need that's narrow but genuine is a better starting point than one that's broad but hypothetical. So even if the problem is simply that you don't have a date on Saturday night, if you can think of a way to fix that by writing software, you're onto something, because a lot of other people have the same problem.\r\n\r\n8. No room for more startups\r\n\r\nA lot of people look at the ever-increasing number of startups and think \"this can't continue.\" Implicit in their thinking is a fallacy: that there is some limit on the number of startups there could be. But this is false. No one claims there's any limit on the number of people who can work for salary at 1000-person companies. Why should there be any limit on the number who can work for equity at 5-person companies? [3]\r\n\r\nNearly everyone who works is satisfying some kind of need. Breaking up companies into smaller units doesn't make those needs go away. Existing needs would probably get satisfied more efficiently by a network of startups than by a few giant, hierarchical organizations, but I don't think that would mean less opportunity, because satisfying current needs would lead to more. Certainly this tends to be the case in individuals. Nor is there anything wrong with that. We take for granted things that medieval kings would have considered effeminate luxuries, like whole buildings heated to spring temperatures year round. And if things go well, our descendants will take for granted things we would consider shockingly luxurious. There is no absolute standard for material wealth. Health care is a component of it, and that alone is a black hole. For the foreseeable future, people will want ever more material wealth, so there is no limit to the amount of work available for companies, and for startups in particular.\r\n\r\nUsually the limited-room fallacy is not expressed directly. Usually it's implicit in statements like \"there are only so many startups Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo can buy.\" Maybe, though the list of acquirers is a lot longer than that. And whatever you think of other acquirers, Google is not stupid. The reason big companies buy startups is that they've created something valuable. And why should there be any limit to the number of valuable startups companies can acquire, any more than there is a limit to the amount of wealth individual people want? Maybe there would be practical limits on the number of startups any one acquirer could assimilate, but if there is value to be had, in the form of upside that founders are willing to forgo in return for an immediate payment, acquirers will evolve to consume it. Markets are pretty smart that way.\r\n\r\n9. Family to support\r\n\r\nThis one is real. I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start a startup. I'm not saying it's a bad idea, just that I don't want to take responsibility for advising it. I'm willing to take responsibility for telling 22 year olds to start startups. So what if they fail? They'll learn a lot, and that job at Microsoft will still be waiting for them if they need it. But I'm not prepared to cross moms.\r\n\r\nWhat you can do, if you have a family and want to start a startup, is start a consulting business you can then gradually turn into a product business. Empirically the chances of pulling that off seem very small. You're never going to produce Google this way. But at least you'll never be without an income.\r\n\r\nAnother way to decrease the risk is to join an existing startup instead of starting your own. Being one of the first employees of a startup is a lot like being a founder, in both the good ways and the bad. You'll be roughly 1/n^2 founder, where n is your employee number.\r\n\r\nAs with the question of cofounders, the real lesson here is to start startups when you're young.\r\n\r\n10. Independently wealthy\r\n\r\nThis is my excuse for not starting a startup. Startups are stressful. Why do it if you don't need the money? For every \"serial entrepreneur,\" there are probably twenty sane ones who think \"Start another company? Are you crazy?\"\r\n\r\nI've come close to starting new startups a couple times, but I always pull back because I don't want four years of my life to be consumed by random schleps. I know this business well enough to know you can't do it half-heartedly. What makes a good startup founder so dangerous is his willingness to endure infinite schleps.\r\n\r\nThere is a bit of a problem with retirement, though. Like a lot of people, I like to work. And one of the many weird little problems you discover when you get rich is that a lot of the interesting people you'd like to work with are not rich. They need to work at something that pays the bills. Which means if you want to have them as colleagues, you have to work at something that pays the bills too, even though you don't need to. I think this is what drives a lot of serial entrepreneurs, actually.\r\n\r\nThat's why I love working on Y Combinator so much. It's an excuse to work on something interesting with people I like.\r\n\r\n11. Not ready for commitment\r\n\r\nThis was my reason for not starting a startup for most of my twenties. Like a lot of people that age, I valued freedom most of all. I was reluctant to do anything that required a commitment of more than a few months. Nor would I have wanted to do anything that completely took over my life the way a startup does. And that's fine. If you want to spend your time travelling around, or playing in a band, or whatever, that's a perfectly legitimate reason not to start a company.\r\n\r\nIf you start a startup that succeeds, it's going to consume at least three or four years. (If it fails, you'll be done a lot quicker.) So you shouldn't do it if you're not ready for commitments on that scale. Be aware, though, that if you get a regular job, you'll probably end up working there for as long as a startup would take, and you'll find you have much less spare time than you might expect. So if you're ready to clip on that ID badge and go to that orientation session, you may also be ready to start that startup.\r\n\r\n12. Need for structure\r\n\r\nI'm told there are people who need structure in their lives. This seems to be a nice way of saying they need someone to tell them what to do. I believe such people exist. There's plenty of empirical evidence: armies, religious cults, and so on. They may even be the majority.\r\n\r\nIf you're one of these people, you probably shouldn't start a startup. In fact, you probably shouldn't even go to work for one. In a good startup, you don't get told what to do very much. There may be one person whose job title is CEO, but till the company has about twelve people no one should be telling anyone what to do. That's too inefficient. Each person should just do what they need to without anyone telling them.\r\n\r\nIf that sounds like a recipe for chaos, think about a soccer team. Eleven people manage to work together in quite complicated ways, and yet only in occasional emergencies does anyone tell anyone else what to do. A reporter once asked David Beckham if there were any language problems at Real Madrid, since the players were from about eight different countries. He said it was never an issue, because everyone was so good they never had to talk. They all just did the right thing.\r\n\r\nHow do you tell if you're independent-minded enough to start a startup? If you'd bristle at the suggestion that you aren't, then you probably are.\r\n\r\n13. Fear of uncertainty\r\n\r\nPerhaps some people are deterred from starting startups because they don't like the uncertainty. If you go to work for Microsoft, you can predict fairly accurately what the next few years will be like—all too accurately, in fact. If you start a startup, anything might happen.\r\n\r\nWell, if you're troubled by uncertainty, I can solve that problem for you: if you start a startup, it will probably fail. Seriously, though, this is not a bad way to think about the whole experience. Hope for the best, but expect the worst. In the worst case, it will at least be interesting. In the best case you might get rich.\r\n\r\nNo one will blame you if the startup tanks, so long as you made a serious effort. There may once have been a time when employers would regard that as a mark against you, but they wouldn't now. I asked managers at big companies, and they all said they'd prefer to hire someone who'd tried to start a startup and failed over someone who'd spent the same time working at a big company.\r\n\r\nNor will investors hold it against you, as long as you didn't fail out of laziness or incurable stupidity. I'm told there's a lot of stigma attached to failing in other places—in Europe, for example. Not here. In America, companies, like practically everything else, are disposable.\r\n\r\n14. Don't realize what you're avoiding\r\n\r\nOne reason people who've been out in the world for a year or two make better founders than people straight from college is that they know what they're avoiding. If their startup fails, they'll have to get a job, and they know how much jobs suck.\r\n\r\nIf you've had summer jobs in college, you may think you know what jobs are like, but you probably don't. Summer jobs at technology companies are not real jobs. If you get a summer job as a waiter, that's a real job. Then you have to carry your weight. But software companies don't hire students for the summer as a source of cheap labor. They do it in the hope of recruiting them when they graduate. So while they're happy if you produce, they don't expect you to.\r\n\r\nThat will change if you get a real job after you graduate. Then you'll have to earn your keep. And since most of what big companies do is boring, you're going to have to work on boring stuff. Easy, compared to college, but boring. At first it may seem cool to get paid for doing easy stuff, after paying to do hard stuff in college. But that wears off after a few months. Eventually it gets demoralizing to work on dumb stuff, even if it's easy and you get paid a lot.\r\n\r\nAnd that's not the worst of it. The thing that really sucks about having a regular job is the expectation that you're supposed to be there at certain times. Even Google is afflicted with this, apparently. And what this means, as everyone who's had a regular job can tell you, is that there are going to be times when you have absolutely no desire to work on anything, and you're going to have to go to work anyway and sit in front of your screen and pretend to. To someone who likes work, as most good hackers do, this is torture.\r\n\r\nIn a startup, you skip all that. There's no concept of office hours in most startups. Work and life just get mixed together. But the good thing about that is that no one minds if you have a life at work. In a startup you can do whatever you want most of the time. If you're a founder, what you want to do most of the time is work. But you never have to pretend to.\r\n\r\nIf you took a nap in your office in a big company, it would seem unprofessional. But if you're starting a startup and you fall asleep in the middle of the day, your cofounders will just assume you were tired.\r\n\r\n15. Parents want you to be a doctor\r\n\r\nA significant number of would-be startup founders are probably dissuaded from doing it by their parents. I'm not going to say you shouldn't listen to them. Families are entitled to their own traditions, and who am I to argue with them? But I will give you a couple reasons why a safe career might not be what your parents really want for you.\r\n\r\nOne is that parents tend to be more conservative for their kids than they would be for themselves. This is actually a rational response to their situation. Parents end up sharing more of their kids' ill fortune than good fortune. Most parents don't mind this; it's part of the job; but it does tend to make them excessively conservative. And erring on the side of conservatism is still erring. In almost everything, reward is proportionate to risk. So by protecting their kids from risk, parents are, without realizing it, also protecting them from rewards. If they saw that, they'd want you to take more risks.\r\n\r\nThe other reason parents may be mistaken is that, like generals, they're always fighting the last war. If they want you to be a doctor, odds are it's not just because they want you to help the sick, but also because it's a prestigious and lucrative career. [4] But not so lucrative or prestigious as it was when their opinions were formed. When I was a kid in the seventies, a doctor was the thing to be. There was a sort of golden triangle involving doctors, Mercedes 450SLs, and tennis. All three vertices now seem pretty dated.\r\n\r\nThe parents who want you to be a doctor may simply not realize how much things have changed. Would they be that unhappy if you were Steve Jobs instead? So I think the way to deal with your parents' opinions about what you should do is to treat them like feature requests. Even if your only goal is to please them, the way to do that is not simply to give them what they ask for. Instead think about why they're asking for something, and see if there's a better way to give them what they need.\r\n\r\n16. A job is the default\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the last and probably most powerful reason people get regular jobs: it's the default thing to do. Defaults are enormously powerful, precisely because they operate without any conscious choice.\r\n\r\nTo almost everyone except criminals, it seems an axiom that if you need money, you should get a job. Actually this tradition is not much more than a hundred years old. Before that, the default way to make a living was by farming. It's a bad plan to treat something only a hundred years old as an axiom. By historical standards, that's something that's changing pretty rapidly.\r\n\r\nWe may be seeing another such change right now. I've read a lot of economic history, and I understand the startup world pretty well, and it now seems to me fairly likely that we're seeing the beginning of a change like the one from farming to manufacturing.\r\n\r\nAnd you know what? If you'd been around when that change began (around 1000 in Europe) it would have seemed to nearly everyone that running off to the city to make your fortune was a crazy thing to do. Though serfs were in principle forbidden to leave their manors, it can't have been that hard to run away to a city. There were no guards patrolling the perimeter of the village. What prevented most serfs from leaving was that it seemed insanely risky. Leave one's plot of land? Leave the people you'd spent your whole life with, to live in a giant city of three or four thousand complete strangers? How would you live? How would you get food, if you didn't grow it?\r\n\r\nFrightening as it seemed to them, it's now the default with us to live by our wits. So if it seems risky to you to start a startup, think how risky it once seemed to your ancestors to live as we do now. Oddly enough, the people who know this best are the very ones trying to get you to stick to the old model. How can Larry and Sergey say you should come work as their employee, when they didn't get jobs themselves?\r\n\r\nNow we look back on medieval peasants and wonder how they stood it. How grim it must have been to till the same fields your whole life with no hope of anything better, under the thumb of lords and priests you had to give all your surplus to and acknowledge as your masters. I wouldn't be surprised if one day people look back on what we consider a normal job in the same way. How grim it would be to commute every day to a cubicle in some soulless office complex, and be told what to do by someone you had to acknowledge as a boss—someone who could call you into their office and say \"take a seat,\" and you'd sit! Imagine having to ask permission to release software to users. Imagine being sad on Sunday afternoons because the weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you'd have to get up and go to work. How did they stand it?\r\n\r\nIt's exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift like the one from farming to manufacturing. That's why I care about startups. Startups aren't interesting just because they're a way to make a lot of money. I couldn't care less about other ways to do that, like speculating in securities. At most those are interesting the way puzzles are. There's more going on with startups. They may represent one of those rare, historic shifts in the way wealth is created.\r\n\r\nThat's ultimately what drives us to work on Y Combinator. We want to make money, if only so we don't have to stop doing it, but that's not the main goal. There have only been a handful of these great economic shifts in human history. It would be an amazing hack to make one happen faster.", "created_on": "2024-02-01T13:05:25Z", "tags": "#startup #paulgraham #ycombinator #tech #eassy", "thumbnail": "thumbnails/stock_S8iCcNP.png", "to_wrap": true, "font": "inherit", "font_size": 0.6, "color": "#14f7c1", "background": "#222222", "font_weight": 100, "animation": 1, "shuffle_colors_by_line": true, "shuffle_fonts_by_line": false}}, {"model": "main.parik", "pk": 10, "fields": {"user": 2, "title": "जय राधा माधव", "description": null, "content": "जय राधा माधव,\r\nजय कुन्ज बिहारी\r\nजय राधा माधव,\r\nजय कुन्ज बिहारी\r\nजय गोपी जन बल्लभ,\r\nजय गिरधर हरी\r\nजय गोपी जन बल्लभ,\r\nजय गिरधर हरी\r\n॥ जय राधा माधव...॥\r\nयशोदा नंदन, ब्रज जन रंजन\r\nयशोदा नंदन, ब्रज जन रंजन\r\nजमुना तीर बन चारि,\r\nजय कुन्ज बिहारी\r\n॥ जय राधा माधव...॥\r\n\r\nमुरली मनोहर करुणा सागर\r\nमुरली मनोहर करुणा सागर\r\nजय गोवर्धन हरी,\r\nजय कुन्ज बिहारी\r\n॥ जय राधा माधव...॥\r\n\r\nहरे कृष्णा हरे कृष्णा,\r\nकृष्णा कृष्णा हरे हरे\r\nहरे कृष्णा हरे कृष्णा,\r\nकृष्णा कृष्णा हरे हरे\r\nहरे रामा हरे रमा,\r\nरामा रामा हरे हरे\r\nहरे रामा हरे रमा,\r\nरामा रामा हरे हरे\r\n\r\nहरे कृष्णा हरे कृष्णा,\r\nकृष्णा कृष्णा हरे हरे\r\nहरे कृष्णा हरे कृष्णा,\r\nकृष्णा कृष्णा हरे हरे\r\nहरे रामा हरे रमा,\r\nरामा रामा हरे हरे\r\nहरे रामा हरे रमा,\r\nरामा रामा हरे हरे", "created_on": "2024-02-02T02:43:34Z", "tags": "#bhajan #radhamadhav", "thumbnail": "thumbnails/stock_6yAuoPg.png", "to_wrap": false, "font": "inherit", "font_size": 0.6, "color": "#ffffff", "background": "#222222", "font_weight": 100, "animation": 2, "shuffle_colors_by_line": true, "shuffle_fonts_by_line": false}}, {"model": "main.parik", "pk": 11, "fields": {"user": 1, "title": "Great Reasons to Visit Antarctica", "description": null, "content": "Antarctica, the coldest area on the planet, is the least explored and least understood.

I now had to think about something I hadn't had to think about before: how not to lose it. I knew it was possible to go from rich to poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich. But while I'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the paths from poor to rich, I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich to poor. Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn where they were.\r\n\r\nSo I started to pay attention to how fortunes are lost. If you'd asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have said by spending all their money. That's how it happens in books and movies, because that's the colorful way to do it. But in fact the way most fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure, but through bad investments.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to spend a fortune without noticing. Someone with ordinary tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a few tens of thousands of dollars without thinking \"wow, I'm spending a lot of money.\" Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you can lose a million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\nIn most people's minds, spending money on luxuries sets off alarms that making investments doesn't. Luxuries seem self-indulgent. And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning a lottery, you've already been thoroughly trained that self-indulgence leads to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms. You're not spending the money; you're just moving it from one asset to another. Which is why people trying to sell you expensive things say \"it's an investment.\"\r\n\r\nThe solution is to develop new alarms. This can be a tricky business, because while the alarms that prevent you from overspending are so basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that prevent you from making bad investments have to be learned, and are sometimes fairly counterintuitive.\r\n\r\nA few days ago I realized something surprising: the situation with time is much the same as with money. The most dangerous way to lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it doing fake work. When you spend time having fun, you know you're being self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly. If I woke up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV all day, I'd feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking about it makes me wince. I'd start to feel uncomfortable after sitting on a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole day.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I've definitely had days when I might as well have sat in front of a TV all day — days at the end of which, if I asked myself what I got done that day, the answer would have been: basically, nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing like as bad as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa watching TV. If I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was descending into perdition. But the same alarms don't go off on the days when I get nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems, superficially, like real work. Dealing with email, for example. You do it sitting at a desk. It's not fun. So it must be work.\r\n\r\nWith time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer enough to protect you. It probably was enough to protect hunter-gatherers, and perhaps all pre-industrial societies. So nature and nurture combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world has gotten more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new behaviors that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by mimicking more virtuous types. And the worst thing is, they're not even fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.", "created_on": "2024-02-06T13:17:44Z", "tags": "#blog #startup #yc", "thumbnail": "thumbnails/stock_GSeciK3.png", "to_wrap": true, "font": "inherit", "font_size": 0.6, "color": "#ffffff", "background": "#222222", "font_weight": 100, "animation": 1, "shuffle_colors_by_line": true, "shuffle_fonts_by_line": false}}, {"model": "main.parik", "pk": 13, "fields": {"user": 4, "title": "Paul Graham - Having Kids", "description": "Link - https://paulgraham.com/kids.html", "content": "Before I had kids, I was afraid of having kids. Up to that point I felt about kids the way the young Augustine felt about living virtuously. I'd have been sad to think I'd never have children. But did I want them now? No.\r\n\r\nIf I had kids, I'd become a parent, and parents, as I'd known since I was a kid, were uncool. They were dull and responsible and had no fun. And while it's not surprising that kids would believe that, to be honest I hadn't seen much as an adult to change my mind. Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids, the kids seemed to be terrors, and the parents pathetic harried creatures, even when they prevailed.\r\n\r\nWhen people had babies, I congratulated them enthusiastically, because that seemed to be what one did. But I didn't feel it at all. \"Better you than me,\" I was thinking.\r\n\r\nNow when people have babies I congratulate them enthusiastically and I mean it. Especially the first one. I feel like they just got the best gift in the world.\r\n\r\nWhat changed, of course, is that I had kids. Something I dreaded turned out to be wonderful.\r\n\r\nPartly, and I won't deny it, this is because of serious chemical changes that happened almost instantly when our first child was born. It was like someone flipped a switch. I suddenly felt protective not just toward our child, but toward all children. As I was driving my wife and new son home from the hospital, I approached a crosswalk full of pedestrians, and I found myself thinking \"I have to be really careful of all these people. Every one of them is someone's child!\"\r\n\r\nSo to some extent you can't trust me when I say having kids is great. To some extent I'm like a religious cultist telling you that you'll be happy if you join the cult too — but only because joining the cult will alter your mind in a way that will make you happy to be a cult member.\r\n\r\nBut not entirely. There were some things about having kids that I clearly got wrong before I had them.\r\n\r\nFor example, there was a huge amount of selection bias in my observations of parents and children. Some parents may have noticed that I wrote \"Whenever I'd noticed parents with kids.\" Of course the times I noticed kids were when things were going wrong. I only noticed them when they made noise. And where was I when I noticed them? Ordinarily I never went to places with kids, so the only times I encountered them were in shared bottlenecks like airplanes. Which is not exactly a representative sample. Flying with a toddler is something very few parents enjoy.\r\n\r\nWhat I didn't notice, because they tend to be much quieter, were all the great moments parents had with kids. People don't talk about these much — the magic is hard to put into words, and all other parents know about them anyway — but one of the great things about having kids is that there are so many times when you feel there is nowhere else you'd rather be, and nothing else you'd rather be doing. You don't have to be doing anything special. You could just be going somewhere together, or putting them to bed, or pushing them on the swings at the park. But you wouldn't trade these moments for anything. One doesn't tend to associate kids with peace, but that's what you feel. You don't need to look any further than where you are right now.\r\n\r\nBefore I had kids, I had moments of this kind of peace, but they were rarer. With kids it can happen several times a day.\r\n\r\nMy other source of data about kids was my own childhood, and that was similarly misleading. I was pretty bad, and was always in trouble for something or other. So it seemed to me that parenthood was essentially law enforcement. I didn't realize there were good times too.\r\n\r\nI remember my mother telling me once when I was about 30 that she'd really enjoyed having me and my sister. My god, I thought, this woman is a saint. She not only endured all the pain we subjected her to, but actually enjoyed it? Now I realize she was simply telling the truth.\r\n\r\nShe said that one reason she liked having us was that we'd been interesting to talk to. That took me by surprise when I had kids. You don't just love them. They become your friends too. They're really interesting. And while I admit small children are disastrously fond of repetition (anything worth doing once is worth doing fifty times) it's often genuinely fun to play with them. That surprised me too. Playing with a 2 year old was fun when I was 2 and definitely not fun when I was 6. Why would it become fun again later? But it does.\r\n\r\nThere are of course times that are pure drudgery. Or worse still, terror. Having kids is one of those intense types of experience that are hard to imagine unless you've had them. But it is not, as I implicitly believed before having kids, simply your DNA heading for the lifeboats.\r\n\r\nSome of my worries about having kids were right, though. They definitely make you less productive. I know having kids makes some people get their act together, but if your act was already together, you're going to have less time to do it in. In particular, you're going to have to work to a schedule. Kids have schedules. I'm not sure if it's because that's how kids are, or because it's the only way to integrate their lives with adults', but once you have kids, you tend to have to work on their schedule.\r\n\r\nYou will have chunks of time to work. But you can't let work spill promiscuously through your whole life, like I used to before I had kids. You're going to have to work at the same time every day, whether inspiration is flowing or not, and there are going to be times when you have to stop, even if it is.\r\n\r\nI've been able to adapt to working this way. Work, like love, finds a way. If there are only certain times it can happen, it happens at those times. So while I don't get as much done as before I had kids, I get enough done.\r\n\r\nI hate to say this, because being ambitious has always been a part of my identity, but having kids may make one less ambitious. It hurts to see that sentence written down. I squirm to avoid it. But if there weren't something real there, why would I squirm? The fact is, once you have kids, you're probably going to care more about them than you do about yourself. And attention is a zero-sum game. Only one idea at a time can be the top idea in your mind. Once you have kids, it will often be your kids, and that means it will less often be some project you're working on.\r\n\r\nI have some hacks for sailing close to this wind. For example, when I write essays, I think about what I'd want my kids to know. That drives me to get things right. And when I was writing Bel, I told my kids that once I finished it I'd take them to Africa. When you say that sort of thing to a little kid, they treat it as a promise. Which meant I had to finish or I'd be taking away their trip to Africa. Maybe if I'm really lucky such tricks could put me net ahead. But the wind is there, no question.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, what kind of wimpy ambition do you have if it won't survive having kids? Do you have so little to spare?\r\n\r\nAnd while having kids may be warping my present judgement, it hasn't overwritten my memory. I remember perfectly well what life was like before. Well enough to miss some things a lot, like the ability to take off for some other country at a moment's notice. That was so great. Why did I never do that?\r\n\r\nSee what I did there? The fact is, most of the freedom I had before kids, I never used. I paid for it in loneliness, but I never used it.\r\n\r\nI had plenty of happy times before I had kids. But if I count up happy moments, not just potential happiness but actual happy moments, there are more after kids than before. Now I practically have it on tap, almost any bedtime.\r\n\r\nPeople's experiences as parents vary a lot, and I know I've been lucky. But I think the worries I had before having kids must be pretty common, and judging by other parents' faces when they see their kids, so must the happiness that kids bring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote\r\n\r\n[1] Adults are sophisticated enough to see 2 year olds for the fascinatingly complex characters they are, whereas to most 6 year olds, 2 year olds are just defective 6 year olds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to Trevor Blackwell, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.", "created_on": "2024-02-06T13:21:58Z", "tags": "#startup #kids #paulgraham #yc", "thumbnail": "thumbnails/stock_tC6VoYP.png", "to_wrap": true, "font": "inherit", "font_size": 0.6, "color": "#ffffff", "background": "#222222", "font_weight": 100, "animation": 1, "shuffle_colors_by_line": true, "shuffle_fonts_by_line": false}}, {"model": "main.parik", "pk": 14, "fields": {"user": 4, "title": "Paul Graham - Why It's Safe for Founders to be Nice", "description": "Link https://paulgraham.com/safe.html", "content": "I recently got an email from a founder that helped me understand something important: why it's safe for startup founders to be nice people.\r\n\r\nI grew up with a cartoon idea of a very successful businessman (in the cartoon it was always a man): a rapacious, cigar-smoking, table-thumping guy in his fifties who wins by exercising power, and isn't too fussy about how. As I've written before, one of the things that has surprised me most about startups is how few of the most successful founders are like that. Maybe successful people in other industries are; I don't know; but not startup founders. [1]\r\n\r\nI knew this empirically, but I never saw the math of why till I got this founder's email. In it he said he worried that he was fundamentally soft-hearted and tended to give away too much for free. He thought perhaps he needed \"a little dose of sociopath-ness.\"\r\n\r\nI told him not to worry about it, because so long as he built something good enough to spread by word of mouth, he'd have a superlinear growth curve. If he was bad at extracting money from people, at worst this curve would be some constant multiple less than 1 of what it might have been. But a constant multiple of any curve is exactly the same shape. The numbers on the Y axis are smaller, but the curve is just as steep, and when anything grows at the rate of a successful startup, the Y axis will take care of itself.\r\n\r\nSome examples will make this clear. Suppose your company is making $1000 a month now, and you've made something so great that it's growing at 5% a week. Two years from now, you'll be making about $160k a month.\r\n\r\nNow suppose you're so un-rapacious that you only extract half as much from your users as you could. That means two years later you'll be making $80k a month instead of $160k. How far behind are you? How long will it take to catch up with where you'd have been if you were extracting every penny? A mere 15 weeks. After two years, the un-rapacious founder is only 3.5 months behind the rapacious one. [2]\r\n\r\nIf you're going to optimize a number, the one to choose is your growth rate. Suppose as before that you only extract half as much from users as you could, but that you're able to grow 6% a week instead of 5%. Now how are you doing compared to the rapacious founder after two years? You're already ahead—$214k a month versus $160k—and pulling away fast. In another year you'll be making $4.4 million a month to the rapacious founder's $2 million.\r\n\r\nObviously one case where it would help to be rapacious is when growth depends on that. What makes startups different is that usually it doesn't. Startups usually win by making something so great that people recommend it to their friends. And being rapacious not only doesn't help you do that, but probably hurts. [3]\r\n\r\nThe reason startup founders can safely be nice is that making great things is compounded, and rapacity isn't.\r\n\r\nSo if you're a founder, here's a deal you can make with yourself that will both make you happy and make your company successful. Tell yourself you can be as nice as you want, so long as you work hard on your growth rate to compensate. Most successful startups make that tradeoff unconsciously.

If you are seeking the meaning of life in some dogma, in some philosophy, in some theology, that is the sure way to miss life and meaning both.\r\nLife is not somewhere waiting for you, it is happening in you.

He sought help from psychiatrists but nothing came of it, for there were none who could tell him the meaning of life – which is what he wanted to know. By and by he learned of a venerable and incredibly wise guru who lived in a mysterious and most inaccessible region of the Himalayas. Only that guru, he came to believe, would tell him what life means and what his role in it ought to be. So he sold all his worldly possessions and began his search for the all-knowing guru. He spent eight years wandering from village to village throughout the Himalayas in an effort to find him. And then one day he chanced upon a shepherd who told him where the guru lived and how to reach the place.\r\nIt took him almost a year to find him, but he eventually did. There he came upon his guru, who was indeed venerable, in fact well over one hundred years old. The guru consented to help him, especially when he learned of all the sacrifices the man had made toward this end.\r\n“What can I do for you, my son?” asked the guru.\r\n“I need to know the meaning of life,” said the man.\r\nTo this the guru replied, without hesitation, “Life,” he said, “is a river without end.”\r\n“A river without end?” said the man in a startled surprise. “After coming all this way to find you, all you have to tell me is that life is a river without end?”\r\nThe guru was shaken, shocked. He became very angry and he said, “You mean it is not?”\r\n\r\nNobody can give you the meaning of your life. It is your life; the meaning has also to be yours. Himalayas won’t help. Nobody except you can come upon it. It is your life and it is only accessible to you. Only in living will the mystery be revealed to you.\r\nThe first thing I would like to tell you is: don’t seek it anywhere else. Don’t seek it in me, don’t seek it in scriptures, don’t seek it in clever explanations – they all explain away; they do not explain. They simply stuff your empty mind; they don’t make you aware of what is. And the more the mind is stuffed with dead knowledge, the more dull and stupid you become. Knowledge makes people stupid; it dulls their sensitivity. It stuffs them, it becomes a weight on them, it strengthens their ego but it does not give light and it does not show them the way. That is not possible.\r\nLife is already there bubbling within you. It can be contacted only there. The temple is not outside; you are the shrine of it. So the first thing to remember if you want to know what life is, is: never seek it without, never try to find out from somebody else. The meaning cannot be transferred that way. The greatest masters have never said anything about life – they have always thrown you back upon yourself.\r\nThe second thing to remember is: once you know what life is you will know what death is because death is also part of the same process. Ordinarily we think death comes at the end, ordinarily we think death is against life, ordinarily we think death is the enemy. Death is not the enemy. And if you think of death as the enemy it simply shows that you have not been able to know what life is.\r\nDeath and life are two polarities of the same energy, of the same phenomenon – the tide and the ebb, the day and the night, the summer and the winter. They are not separate and not opposites, not contraries; they are complementary. Death is not the end of life; in fact, it is a completion of one life, the crescendo of one life, the climax, the finale. And once you know your life and its process, then you understand what death is.\r\nDeath is an organic, integral part of life, and it is very friendly to life. Without it life cannot exist. Life exists because of death; death gives the background. Death is, in fact, a process of renewal. And death also happens each moment, as life happens, because the renewal is needed each moment. The moment you breathe in and the moment you breathe out, both happen. Breathing in, life happens; breathing out, death happens. That’s why when a child is born the first thing he does is breathe in; then life starts. And when an old man is dying, the last thing he does is breathe out; then life departs. Breathing out is death, breathing in is life – and both are like two wheels of a bullock cart.\r\nYou live by breathing in as much as you live by breathing out. The breathing out is part of breathing in. You cannot breathe in if you stop breathing out. You cannot live if you stop dying. The man who has understood what his life is allows death to happen; he welcomes it. He dies each moment and each moment he is resurrected. His cross and his resurrection are continuously happening as a process. He dies to the past each moment and he is born again and again into the future.\r\nIf you look into life you will be able to know what death is. If you understand what death is, only then are you able to understand what life is. They are organic. Ordinarily, out of fear, we have created a division. We think that life is good and death is bad. We think that life has to be desired and death is to be avoided. We think somehow we have to protect ourselves against death. This absurd idea creates endless miseries in our lives, because a person who protects himself against death becomes incapable of living. He is the person who is afraid of exhaling, then he cannot inhale; then he is stuck. Then he simply drags; his life is no longer a flow, his life is no more a river.\r\nIf you really want to live, you have to be ready to die. Who is afraid of death in you? Is life afraid of death? It is not possible. How can life be afraid of its own integral process? Something else is afraid in you. The ego is afraid in you. Life and death are not opposites; ego and death are opposites. Life and death are not opposites; ego and life are opposites. Ego is against both life and death. The ego is afraid to live and the ego is afraid to die. It is afraid to live because each effort, each step toward life, brings death closer.\r\nIf you live you are coming closer to dying. The ego is afraid to die, hence it is afraid to live also. The ego simply drags.\r\nThere are many people who are neither alive nor dead. This is worse than anything. A man who is fully alive is full of death also. That is the meaning of Jesus on the cross. Jesus carrying his own cross has not really been understood. And he says to his disciples, “You will have to carry your own cross.” The meaning of Jesus carrying his own cross is very simple, nothing but this: everybody has to carry his death continuously, everybody has to die each moment, everybody has to be on the cross because that is the only way to live fully, totally.\r\nWhenever you come to a total moment of aliveness, suddenly you will see death there also. In love it happens. In love, life comes to a climax – hence people are afraid of love.\r\nI have been continually surprised by people who come to me and say they are afraid of love. What is the fear of love? – because when you really love somebody your ego starts slipping and melting. You cannot love with the ego; the ego becomes a barrier. And when you would like to drop the barrier the ego says, “This is going to be a death. Beware!”\r\nThe death of the ego is not your death. The death of the ego is really your possibility of life. The ego is just a dead crust around you, it has to be broken and thrown away. It comes into being naturally – just as when a traveler passes the dust collects on his clothes, on his body, and he has to take a bath to get rid of the dust.\r\nAs we move in time the dust of experiences, of knowledge, of lived life, of the past, collects. That dust becomes our ego. Accumulated, it becomes a crust around you which has to be broken and thrown away. One has to take a bath continuously – every day, in fact every moment – so that this crust never becomes a prison. The ego is afraid to love because in love, life comes to a peak. But whenever there is a peak of life there is also a peak of death – they go together.\r\nIn love you die and you are reborn. The same happens when you come to meditate or to pray, or when you come to a master to surrender. The ego creates all sorts of difficulties, rationalizations not to surrender: “Think about it, brood about it, be clever about it.” When you come to a master, again the ego becomes suspicious, doubtful, creates anxiety. Again you are coming to life, to a flame where death will also be as much alive as life.\r\nLet it be remembered that death and life both become aflame together; they are never separate. If you are very, very minimally alive, at the minimum, then you can see death and life as being separate. The closer you come to the peak, the closer they start coming. At the very apex they meet and become one. In love, in meditation, in trust, in prayerfulness, wherever life becomes total, death is there. Without death, life cannot become total.\r\nBut the ego always thinks in divisions, in dualities; it divides everything. Existence is indivisible; it cannot be divided. You were a child, then you became young. Can you demark the line when you became young? Can you demark the point in time where suddenly you were no longer a child and you had become young? One day you became old. Can you demark the line when you became old?\r\nProcesses cannot be demarked. Exactly the same happens when you are born. Can you demark when you are born? When life really starts? Does it start when the child starts breathing – the doctor spanks the child and the child starts breathing? Then life is born? – or is it when the child got into the womb, the mother became pregnant, the child was conceived? Did life start then? – or even before that? When does life exactly start?\r\nIt is a process of no ending and no beginning. It never starts. When is a person dead? When the breathing stops? Many yogis have now proved it on scientific grounds that they can stop breathing and they are still alive and they can come back. So the stopping of the breathing cannot be the end. Where does life end?\r\nIt never ends anywhere, it never begins anywhere. We are involved in eternity. We have been here since the very beginning – if there was any beginning – and we are going to be here to the very end, if there is going to be any end. In fact, there cannot be any beginning and there cannot be any end. We are life – forms change, bodies change, minds change. What we call life is just an identification with a certain body, with a certain mind, with a certain attitude, and what we call death is nothing but getting out of that form, out of that body, out of that concept.\r\nYou change houses. If you get too identified with one house, then changing the house will be very painful. You will think that you are dying because the old house was what you were – that was your identity. But this doesn’t happen, because you know that you are only changing the house, you remain the same. Those who have looked within themselves, those who have found who they are, come to know an eternal, non-ending process. Life is a process, timeless, beyond time. Death is part of it.\r\nDeath is a continuous revival, a help to life to resurrect again and again, a help to life to get rid of old forms, to get rid of dilapidated buildings, to get rid of old confining structures so that again you can flow and you can again become fresh and young, and you can again become virgin.\r\nI have heard:\r\n\r\nA man was browsing through an antique shop near Mount Vernon and ran across a rather ancient-looking axe.\r\n“That’s a mighty old axe you have there,” he said to the shop owner.\r\n“Yes,” said the man, “it once belonged to George Washington.”\r\n“Really?” said the customer. “It certainly stood up well.”\r\n“Of course,” said the antique dealer, “it has had three new handles and two new heads.”\r\n\r\nBut that’s how life is – it goes on changing handles and heads. In fact it seems everything goes on changing and yet something remains eternally the same. Just watch. You were a child – what has remained of that now? Just a memory. Your body has changed, your mind has changed, your identity has changed. What has remained of your childhood? Nothing has remained, just a memory. You cannot even make a distinction between whether it really happened or you had seen a dream, or you had read it in a book, or somebody has told you about it – whether the childhood was yours or somebody else’s? Sometimes have a look at an album of old photographs. Just see, this was you. You will not be able to believe it, you have changed so much. In fact everything has changed – handles and heads and everything has changed. And still, deep down, somewhere, something remains a continuity; a witnessing remains continuous.\r\nThere is a thread, howsoever invisible. Everything goes on changing. That invisible thread remains the same. That thread is beyond life and death. Life and death are two wings for that which is beyond life and death. That which is beyond goes on using life and death as two wheels of a cart, complementaries. It lives through life; it lives through death. Death and life are its processes, like inhalation, exhalation.\r\nBut something in you is transcendental. That art thou… That is transcendental.\r\nBut we are too identified with the form – that creates the ego. That’s what we call “I”. Of course the “I” has to die many times. It is constantly in fear, trembling, shaking, always afraid, protecting, securing.\r\n\r\nA Sufi mystic knocked at the door of a very rich man. He was a beggar and he wanted just enough so that he could have his meal.\r\nThe rich man shouted at him and said, “Nobody knows you here!”\r\n“But I know myself,” said the dervish. “How sad it would be if the reverse were true. If everybody knew me and I was not aware of who I am, how sad it would be. Yes, you are right, nobody knows me here. But I know myself.”\r\n\r\nThese are the only two situations possible. And you are in the sad situation – everybody may be knowing about you, who you are, but you yourself are completely oblivious of your transcendence, of your real nature, of your authentic being. This is the only sadness in life. You can find many excuses, but the real sadness is this: you don’t know who you are.\r\nHow can a person be happy not knowing who he is, not knowing from where he is coming, not knowing where he is going? Then a thousand and one problems arise because of this basic self-ignorance.\r\n\r\nA bunch of ants came out of the darkness of their underground nest in search of food. It was early in the morning. The ants happened to pass by a plant whose leaves were covered with morning dew.\r\n“What are these?” asked one of the ants, pointing to the dewdrops. “Where do they come from?”\r\nSome said, “They come from the earth.”\r\nOthers said, “They come from the sea.”\r\nSoon a quarrel broke out – there was a group who adhered to the sea theory, and a group who attached themselves to the earth theory.\r\nOnly one, a wise and intelligent ant, stood alone. He said, “Let us pause a moment and look around for signs, for everything has an attraction toward its source. Or, as it is said, everything returns to its origin. No matter how far into the air you throw a brick it comes down to the earth. Whatever leans toward the light, must originally be of the light.”\r\nThe ants were not totally convinced yet and were about to resume their dispute, but the sun had come up and the dewdrops were leaving the leaves, rising, rising toward the sun and disappearing into the sun.\r\n\r\nEverything returns to its original source, has to return to its original source. If you understand life then you understand death also. Life is a forgetfulness of the original source, and death is again a remembrance. Life is going away from the original source, death is coming back home. Death is not ugly, death is beautiful. But death is beautiful only for those who have lived their life unhindered, uninhibited, unsuppressed. Death is beautiful only for those who have lived their life beautifully, who have not been afraid to live, who have been courageous to live – who loved, who danced, who celebrated.\r\nDeath becomes the ultimate celebration if your life is a celebration. Let me tell you in this way: whatsoever your life is, death reveals only that. If you have been miserable in life, death reveals misery. Death is a great revealer. If you have been happy in your life, death reveals happiness. If you have lived only a life of physical comfort and physical pleasure, then of course death is going to be very uncomfortable and unpleasant because the body has to be left. The body is just a temporary abode, a serai in which we stay for the night and have to leave in the morning. It is not your permanent abode, it is not your home.\r\nSo if you have lived just a bodily life and you have never known anything beyond the body, death is going to be very, very ugly, unpleasant, painful. Death is going to be an anguish. But if you have lived a little higher than the body – if you have loved music and poetry, and you have loved, and you have looked at the flowers and the stars, and something of the non-physical has entered into your consciousness – death will not be so bad, death will not be so painful. You can take it with equanimity, but still it cannot be a celebration.\r\nIf you have lived something of the transcendental in yourself, if you have entered your own nothingness at the center, the center of your being – where you are no longer a body and no longer a mind; where physical pleasures are completely left far away and mental pleasures also: the pleasures of music and poetry and literature and painting – then death is going to be a great celebration, a great understanding, a great revelation. Everything is left far away; you are simply just pure awareness, consciousness.\r\nIf you have known anything of the transcendental in you, death will reveal to you the transcendental in the universe – then death is no more a death but a meeting with existence, a date with existence.\r\nSo you can find three expressions about death in the history of human mind. One expression is of the ordinary man who lives attached to his body, who has never known anything greater than the pleasure of food or sex, whose whole life has been nothing but food and sex, who has enjoyed food, has enjoyed sex, whose life has been very primitive, whose life has been very gross, who has lived in the porch of his palace, never entered it, and who had been thinking that this is all life is. Then at the moment of death he will try to cling. He will resist death, he will fight death. Death will come as the enemy.\r\nHence, all over the world, in all societies, death is depicted as dark, as devilish. In India they say the messenger of death is very ugly – dark, black – and comes sitting on a very big, ugly buffalo. This is the ordinary attitude. These people missed, they have not been able to know all the dimensions of life. They have not been able to touch the depth of life and they have not been able to fly to the height of life. They missed the plenitude, they missed the benediction.\r\nThen there is a second type of expression. Poets, philosophers, have sometimes said that death is nothing bad, death is nothing evil, it is just restful – a great rest, like sleep. This is better than the first. At least these people have known something beyond the body, they have known something of the mind. They have not had only food and sex, their whole life has not been only in eating and reproducing. They have a little sophistication of the soul, they are a little more aristocratic, more cultured. They say death is like great rest; one is tired and one goes into death and rests. It is restful. But they too are far away from the truth.\r\nThose who have known life in its deepest core say that death is godliness; not only a rest, but a resurrection, a new life, a new beginning; a new door opens.\r\n\r\nWhen a Sufi mystic, Bayazid, was dying, people who had gathered around him – his disciples – were suddenly surprised, because when the last moment came his face became radiant, so powerfully radiant. It had such a beautiful aura. Bayazid was a beautiful man, and his disciples had always felt an aura around him, but they had not known anything like this; so radiant.\r\nThey asked, “Bayazid, tell us what has happened to you. What is happening to you? Before you leave us, give us your last message.”\r\nHe opened his eyes and he said, “Existence is welcoming me. I am going into its embrace. Good-bye.”\r\nHe closed his eyes, his breathing stopped. But at the moment his breathing stopped there was an explosion of light, the room became full of light, and then the light disappeared.\r\nWhen a person has known the transcendental in himself, death is nothing but a face of existence. Then death has a dance to it. And unless you become capable of celebrating death itself, remember, you have missed life. The whole life is a preparation for this ultimate.\r\nThis is the meaning of this beautiful story:\r\nWhen Rabbi Birnham lay dying,\r\nhis wife burst into tears.\r\nHe said, “What are you crying for?\r\nMy whole life was only that I might learn how to die.”\r\n“My whole life has been just a preparation, a preparation to learn the secrets of dying.”\r\nAll religions are nothing but a science – or an art – to teach you how to die. And the only way to teach you how to die is to teach you how to live. They are not separate. If you know what right living is, you will know what right dying is.\r\nSo the first thing, or the most fundamental thing, is: how to live.\r\nLet me tell you a few things. First: your life is your life, it is nobody else’s. So don’t allow yourself to be dominated by others, don’t allow yourself to be dictated to by others; it is a betrayal of life. If you allow yourself to be dictated to by others – maybe your parents, your society, your education system, your politicians, your priests, whosoever they are – if you allow yourself to be dominated by others you will miss your life. Because the domination comes from outside and life is within you. They never meet.\r\nI am not saying that you should become a no-sayer to each and everything. That too is not of much help. There are two types of people. One is a very obedient type, ready to surrender to any and everybody. They don’t have any independent soul in them; they are immature, childish, always searching for a father-figure, for somebody to tell them what to do and what not to do. They are not able to trust their own being. These people are the greater part of the world, the masses.\r\nThen there are, against these people, a small minority who reject society, who reject the values of the society. They think they are rebellious. They are not, they are only reactionaries. Because whether you listen to society or you reject society, if society remains in either way the determining factor, then you are dominated by the society.\r\nLet me tell you an anecdote:\r\n\r\nOnce Mulla Nasruddin had been away for a while and arrived back in town wearing a long beard. His friends naturally kidded him about the beard and asked him how he happened to acquire the fur-piece. The Mulla with the beard began to complain and curse the thing in no uncertain terms. His friends were amazed at the way he talked and asked him why he continued to wear the beard if he did not like it.\r\n“I hate the blasted thing!” the Mulla told them.\r\n“If you hate it, then why don’t you shave it off and get rid of it?” one of his friends asked.\r\nA devilish gleam shone in the eyes of the Mulla as he answered, “Because my wife hates it too!”\r\n\r\nBut that does not make you free. The hippies, the yippies and others, they are not really rebellious people, they are reactionaries. They have reacted against the society. A few are obedient, a few are disobedient, but the center of domination is the same. A few obey, a few disobey, but nobody looks at his own soul.\r\nA really rebellious person is one who is neither for society nor against society, who simply lives his life according to his own understanding. Whether it goes against society or it goes with society is not a consideration, it is irrelevant. Sometimes it may go with the society, sometimes it may not go with the society, but that is not the point to be considered. He lives according to his understanding, according to his small light. And I am not saying that he becomes very egoistic about it. No, he is very humble. He knows that his light is very small, but that is all the light that there is. He knows that he may be wrong. He is not adamant, he’s very humble. He says, “I may be wrong, but please allow me to be wrong according to myself.”\r\nThat is the only way to learn. To commit mistakes is the only way to learn. To move according to one’s own understanding is the only way to grow and become mature. If you are always looking at somebody to dictate, whether you obey or disobey makes no difference. If you are looking at somebody else to dictate and then you will decide for or against, you will never be able to know what your life is. It has to be lived, and you have to follow your own small light.\r\nIt is not always certain what to do. You are very confused. Let it be so. But find a way out of your confusion. It is very cheap and easy to listen to others because they can hand over dead dogmas to you, they can give you commandments – do this, don’t do that. And they are very certain about their commandments. Certainty should not be sought; understanding should be sought. If you are seeking certainty you will become a victim of some trap or other. Don’t seek certainty, seek understanding. Certainty can be given to you cheap, anybody can give it to you. But in the final analysis you will be a loser. You lost your life just to remain secure and certain, and life is not certain, life is not secure.\r\nLife is insecurity. Each moment is a move into more and more insecurity. It is a gamble. One never knows what is going to happen. And it is beautiful that one never knows. If it was predictable life would not be worth living. If everything was as you would like it and everything was certain you would not be a man at all, you would be a machine. Only for machines everything is secure and certain.\r\nMan lives in freedom. Freedom needs insecurity and uncertainty. A real man of intelligence is always hesitant because he has no dogma to rely upon, to lean upon. He has to look and respond.\r\nLao Tzu says, “I am hesitant, and I move alertly in life because I don’t know what is going to happen. And I don’t have any principle to follow. I have to decide every moment. I never decide beforehand. I have to decide when the moment has come!”\r\nThen one has to be very responsive. That’s what responsibility is. Responsibility is not an obligation, responsibility is not a duty – it is a capacity to respond. A man who wants to know what life is has to be responsive. That is missing. Centuries of conditioning have made you more like machines. You have lost your manhood, you have bargained for security. You are secure and comfortable and everything has been planned by others. And they have put everything on the map, they have measured everything. This is all absolutely foolish because life cannot be measured, it is immeasurable. And no map is possible because life is in constant flux, everything goes on changing. Nothing except change is permanent. Says Heraclitus, “You cannot step in the same river twice.”\r\nAnd the ways of life are very zigzag. The ways of life are not like the tracks of a railway train. No, it does not run on tracks. And that’s the beauty of it, the glory of it, the poetry of it, the music of it – that it is always a surprise.\r\nIf you are seeking for security, certainty, your eyes will become closed and you will be less and less surprised, and you will lose the capacity to wonder. Once you lose the capacity to wonder, you have lost religion. Religion is the opening of your wondering heart. Religion is a receptivity for the mysterious that surrounds us.\r\nDon’t seek security; don’t seek advice on how to live your life. People come to me and they say, “Osho, tell us how we should live our lives.” You are not interested in knowing what life is, you are more interested in making a fixed pattern. You are more interested in killing life than in living it. You want a discipline to be imposed on you.\r\nThere are, of course, priests and politicians all over the world who are ready, just sitting waiting for you. Come to them and they are ready to impose their disciplines on you. They enjoy the power that comes through imposing their own ideas upon others.\r\nI’m not here for that. I am here to help you to become free. And when I say that I am here to help you to become free, I am included. I am to help you to become free of me also. My sannyas is a very paradoxical thing. You surrender to me in order to become free. I accept you and initiate you into sannyas to help you to become absolutely free of every dogma, of every scripture, of every philosophy – and I am included in it. Sannyas is as paradoxical as life itself is – it should be. Then it is alive.\r\nSo the first thing is: don’t ask anybody how you should live your life. Life is so precious – live it! I am not saying that you will not make mistakes; you will. Remember only one thing: don’t make the same mistake again and again. That’s enough. If you can find a new mistake every day, make it. But don’t repeat mistakes; that is foolish. A man who can find new mistakes to make will be growing continuously – that is the only way to learn, that is the only way to come to your own inner light.\r\nI have heard:\r\n\r\nOne night the poet, Awhadi of Kerman, a very great Muslim poet, was sitting on his porch bent over a vessel. Shams e-Tabrizi, a great Sufi mystic, happened to pass by.\r\nShams e-Tabrizi looked at the poet, at what he was doing. He asked the poet, “What are you doing?”\r\nThe poet said, “Contemplating the moon in a bowl of water.”\r\nShams e-Tabrizi started laughing, with an uproarious laughter, a mad laughter. The poet started feeling uncomfortable; a crowd gathered. And the poet said, “What is the matter? Why are you laughing so much? Why are you ridiculing me?”\r\nShams e-Tabrizi said, “Unless you have broken your neck, why don’t you look directly at the moon in the sky?”\r\n\r\nThe moon is there, the full moon is there, and this poet was sitting with a bowl of water and looking into the bowl of water at the reflection of the moon!\r\nSeeking truth in scriptures, seeking truth in philosophies, is looking at the reflection. If you ask somebody else how you should live your life you are asking for misguidance, because that man can only talk about his own life. And never, never, are two lives the same. Whatsoever he can say or impart to you will be about his own life – and that too only if he has lived. He may have asked somebody else, he may have followed somebody else, he may have been an imitator himself; then it is a reflection of a reflection. And centuries pass and people go on reflecting the reflection of the reflection of the reflection – and the real moon is always there in the sky waiting for you.\r\nIt is your moon, it is your sky, look directly. Be immediate about it. Why borrow my eyes or anybody else’s eyes? You have been given eyes, beautiful eyes to see, and to see directly. Why borrow understanding from anybody? Remember, it may be an understanding to me, but the moment you borrow it, it becomes knowledge to you – it is no longer understanding.\r\nUnderstanding is only that which has been experienced by the person himself. It may be understanding for me, if I have looked at the moon, but the moment I say it to you it becomes knowledge, it is no longer understanding. Then it is just verbal, then it is just linguistic. And language is a lie.\r\nLet me tell you an anecdote:\r\n\r\nA chicken farmer, dissatisfied with the productivity of his flock, decided to use a bit of psychology on his hens. Accordingly he purchased a gay-colored, talking parrot and placed him in the barnyard. Sure enough, the hens took to the handsome stranger immediately, pointed out the best tidbits for him to eat with joyous clucks, and generally followed him around like a bevy of teenage girls following a new singing star sensation. To the delight of the farmer, even their egg-laying capacities improved.\r\nThe barnyard rooster, naturally jealous of being ignored by his harem, set upon the attractive interloper, assailed him with beak and claws, pulling out one green or red feather after the other. Whereupon the intimidated parrot cried out in trepidation, “Desist sir! I beg of you, desist! After all, I am only here in the capacity of a language professor!”\r\n\r\nMany people live their life as language professors. That is the falsest kind of life. Reality needs no language; it is available to you on a non-verbal level. The moon is there; it needs no bowl and no water, it needs no other medium. You have just to look at it; it is a non-verbal communication. The whole of life is available – you just have to learn how to communicate with it non-verbally.\r\nThat’s what meditation is all about – to be in such a space where language does not interfere, where learned concepts don’t come in between you and the real.\r\nWhen you love a woman, don’t be bothered about what others have said about love because that is going to be an interference. You love the woman, the love is there, forget all that you have learned about love. Forget all Kinseys, forget all Masters and Johnsons, forget all Freuds and Jungs. Please don’t become a language professor. Just love the woman and let love be there, and let love lead you and guide you into its innermost secrets, into its mysteries. Then you will be able to know what love is.\r\nWhat others say about meditation is meaningless. Once I came upon a book about meditation written by a Jaina saint. It was really beautiful, but there were a few places by which I could see that the man had never meditated himself – otherwise those places could not be there. But they were very few and far between. The book on the whole, almost ninety-nine per cent, was perfect. I loved the book. Then I forgot about it.\r\nFor ten years I was wandering around the country. Once in a village of Rajasthan, that saint came to meet me. His name looked familiar, and suddenly I remembered the book. And I asked the saint why he had come to me. He said, “I have come to you to know what meditation is.”\r\nI said, “I remember your book. I remember it very well, because it really impressed me. Except for a few defects which showed that you have never meditated, the book was perfectly right – ninety-nine percent right. And now you come here to learn about meditation. Have you never meditated?”\r\nHe looked a little embarrassed because his disciples were also there. I said, “Be frank. Because if you say you know meditation, then I am not going to talk about it. Then finished! You know; there is no need. If you say to me frankly – at least be true once – if you say you have never meditated, only then can I help you toward meditation.”\r\nIt was a bargain, so he had to confess. He said, “Yes, I have never said it to anybody. I have read many books about meditation, all the old scriptures. And I have been teaching people, that’s why I feel embarrassed before my disciples. I have been teaching meditation to thousands, and I have written books about it, but I have never meditated.”\r\nYou can write books about meditation and never come across the space that meditation is. You can become so efficient in verbalizing, you can become so clever in abstraction, in intellectual argumentativeness, and you can forget completely that all the time that you have been involved in these intellectual activities has been a sheer wastage.\r\nI asked the old man, “How long have you been interested in meditation?”\r\nHe said, “My whole life.” He was almost seventy. He said, “When I was twenty I took sannyas, I became a Jaina monk, and those fifty years since then I have been reading and reading and thinking about meditation.”\r\nFifty years of thinking and reading and writing about meditation, even guiding people into meditation, and he has not even tasted once what meditation is!\r\nAnd this is the case with millions of people. They talk about love, they know all the poetries about love, but they have never loved. Or even if they thought they were in love, they were never in love. That too was a “heady” thing, it was not of the heart. People live and go on missing life. It needs courage. It needs courage to be realistic; it needs courage to move with life wherever it leads. The paths are uncharted, there exists no map. One has to go into the unknown.\r\nLife can be understood only if you are ready to go into the unknown. If you cling to the known you cling to the mind, and the mind is not life. Life is non-mental, non-intellectual, because life is total. Your totality has to be involved in it, you cannot just think about it. Thinking about life is not life; beware of this “about-ism.” One goes on thinking about and about: there are people who think about God, there are people who think about life, there are people who think about love. There are people who think about this and that.\r\n\r\nMulla Nasruddin became very old and he went to his doctor. He was looking very weak so the doctor said, “I can say only one thing. You will have to cut your love life to half.”\r\nThe Mulla said, “Okay. Which half? Talking about it or thinking about it?”\r\n\r\nThat’s all. Don’t become a language professor, don’t become a parrot. Parrots are language professors. They live in words, concepts, theories, theologies, and life goes on passing, slipping out of their hands. Then one day suddenly they become afraid of death. When a person is afraid of death, know well that that person has missed life. If he has not missed life there cannot be any fear of death. If a person has lived life, he will be ready to live death also. He will be almost enchanted by the phenomenon of death.\r\n\r\nWhen Socrates was dying he was so enchanted that his disciples could not understand what he was feeling so happy about. One disciple, Credo, asked, “Why are you looking so happy? We are crying and weeping.”\r\nSocrates said, “Why should I not be happy? I have known what life is, now I would like to know what death is. I am at the door of a great mystery, and I am thrilled! I am going on a great journey into the unknown. I am simply full of wonder! I cannot wait!” And remember, Socrates was not a religious man; Socrates was not in any way a believer.\r\nSomebody asked, “Are you so certain that the soul will survive after death?”\r\nSocrates said, “I don’t know.”\r\nTo say “I don’t know” is the greatest courage in the world. It is very difficult for the language professors to say “I don’t know.” It is difficult for the parrots. Socrates was a very sincere and honest man. He said, “I don’t know.”\r\nThen the disciple asked, “Then why are you feeling so happy? If the soul does not survive, then…?”\r\nSocrates said, “I have to see. If I survive there can be no fear about it. If I don’t survive, how can there be fear? If I don’t survive, I don’t survive. Then where is the fear? There is nobody there, so fear cannot exist. If I survive, I survive. There is no point in getting afraid about it. But I don’t know exactly what is going to happen. That’s why I am so full of wonder and ready to go into it. I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nTo me, this is what a religious man should be. A religious man is not a Christian, or a Hindu, or a Buddhist, or a Mohammedan. All these are ways of knowledge. A Christian says, “I know.” And his knowledge comes from the Christian dogmas. The Hindu says, “I also know.” And his knowledge comes from the Vedas and the Gitas and his dogmas. And a Hindu is against the Christian, because he says, “If I am right, you cannot be right. If you are right, then I cannot be right.” So there is great argument and there is much dispute and much debate and unnecessary conflict.\r\nA religious man, a really religious man – not the so-called religious people – is one who says “I don’t know.” When you say “I don’t know,” you are open, you are ready to learn. When you say “I don’t know,” you don’t have any prejudice this way or that, you don’t have any belief, you don’t have any knowledge. You have only awareness. You say, “I am aware and I will see whatsoever happens. I will not carry any dogma from the past.”\r\nThis is the attitude of a disciple, the attitude of one who wants to learn. And discipline simply means learning. A disciple means a learner, one who is ready to learn, and discipline means learning.\r\nI am not here to teach you any dogmas; I am not imparting any knowledge to you. I am simply helping you to see that which is. Live your life whatsoever the cost. Be ready to gamble with it.\r\n\r\nI have heard about a business man. He was walking from his office to a restaurant for lunch when he was stopped by a stranger who said to him, “I don’t think that you remember me, but ten years ago I came to this city broke. I asked you for a loan and you gave me twenty dollars because you said you were willing to take a chance to start a man on the road to success.”\r\nThe business man thought for a while and then he said. “Yes, I remember the incident. Go on with your story.”\r\n“Well,” remarked the stranger, “are you still willing to gamble?”\r\n\r\nLife asks you the same question again and again and again: “Are you still willing to gamble?” It is never certain. Life has no insurance in it; it is simply an opening, a wild opening, a chaotic opening. You can make a small house around you, secure, but then that will prove to be your grave. Live with life.\r\nAnd we have been doing that in many ways. Marriage is man-created; love is part of life. When you create marriage around love you are creating security. You are making something which cannot be made – love cannot be made legal. You are trying to do the impossible, and if in that effort love dies, it is no wonder. You become a husband, your beloved becomes a wife. You are no longer two alive persons; you are two functionaries. The husband has a certain function, the wife has a certain function; they have certain duties to fulfill. Then life has ceased to flow. They are frozen.\r\nWatch a husband and wife. You will always see two persons frozen, sitting side by side, not knowing what they are doing here, why they are sitting here. Maybe they have nowhere to go.\r\nWhen you see love between two persons something is flowing, moving, changing. When there is love between two persons they live in an aura, there is a constant sharing. Their vibrations are reaching to each other; they are broadcasting their being to each other. There is no wall between them, they are two and yet not two – they are one also.\r\nThe husband and wife are as far away as it is possible to be, even though they may be sitting by the side of each other. The husband never listens to what the wife is saying; he has become deaf long ago. The wife never sees what is happening to the husband; she has become blind to him. They take each other absolutely for granted; they have become things. They are no longer persons because persons are always open, persons are always uncertain, persons are always changing. Now they have a fixed role to fulfill. They died the day they got married. Since that day they have not lived.\r\nI’m not saying not to get married, but remember that love is the real thing. And if it dies then marriage is worthless.\r\nAnd the same is true about everything in life, about everything. Either you can live it – but then you have to live with this hesitation, not knowing what is going to happen the next moment – or you can make everything certain about it. There are people who have become so certain about everything that they are never surprised. There are people whom you cannot surprise. And I am here to deliver to you a message which is very surprising – you will not believe it, I know. You cannot believe it, I know. I am here to tell you something which is absolutely unbelievable – that you are gods and goddesses. You have forgotten.\r\nLet me tell you an anecdote:\r\n\r\nHarvey Firestone, Thomas A. Edison, John Burroughs and Henry Ford stopped at a rural service station on their way to Florida for the winter.\r\n“We want some bulbs for our headlights,” said Ford. “And by the way, that is Thomas Edison sitting there in the car, and I am Henry Ford.”\r\nThe fellow at the service station did not even look up, just spat out some tobacco juice with obvious contempt.\r\n“And,” said Ford, “we would like to buy a new tire if you have any Firestone tires. And that other fellow in the car is Harvey Firestone himself.”\r\nStill the old fellow said nothing. While he was placing the tire on the wheel, John Burroughs, with his long white beard, stuck his head out the window and said, “How do you do, stranger?”\r\nFinally the old man at the service station came alive. He glared at Burroughs and said, “If you tell me you are Santa Claus I will be damned if I don’t crush your skull with this lug wrench.”\r\n\r\nHe could not believe that Harvey Firestone, Thomas A. Edison, John Burroughs and Henry Ford were all traveling in one car. They were all friends and they used to travel together.\r\nWhen I say to you, you are gods and goddesses, you will not believe me because you have completely forgotten who is traveling within you, who is sitting within you, who is listening to me, who is looking at me. You have completely forgotten. You have been given some labels from the outside and you have trusted those labels – your name, your religion, your country – all bogus! It does not make any sense if you are a Hindu or a Christian or a Mohammedan if you don’t know yourself. These labels make no sense at all. Maybe they are of a certain utility. What sense does it make whether you are a Hindu, or a Christian, or a Mohammedan, or an Indian, or an American, or Chinese? How does it make sense, how does it help you to know your being? All are irrelevant – because the being is neither Indian, nor Chinese, nor American; and the being is neither Hindu, nor Mohammedan, nor Christian. The being is simply a pure “is-ness.”\r\nThe pure “is-ness” is what I call godliness. If you can understand your inner divinity you have understood what life is. Otherwise you have not been able yet to decode life. This is the message. The whole life is pointing at one thing, continuously – that you are gods. Once you have understood it, then there is no death. Then you have learned the lesson. Then in death gods will be returning back to their homes.\r\nWhen Rabbi Birnham lay dying,\r\nhis wife burst into tears.\r\nHe said, “What are you crying for?\r\nMy whole life was only that I might learn how to die.”\r\nThe whole life – just a training: how to go back home, how to die, how to disappear. Because the moment you disappear, godliness appears in you. Your presence is the absence of godliness; your absence is the presence of godliness.\r\nEnough for today.", "created_on": "2024-02-07T15:13:27Z", "tags": "#osho #discourse #dying", "thumbnail": "thumbnails/stock_6YYPSWL.png", "to_wrap": true, "font": "inherit", "font_size": 0.6, "color": "#ffffff", "background": "#222222", "font_weight": 100, "animation": 1, "shuffle_colors_by_line": true, "shuffle_fonts_by_line": false}}, {"model": "main.parik", "pk": 16, "fields": {"user": 3, "title": "OSHO-The Art of Dying 02", "description": "Second Discourse from the series of 10 discourses - OSHO-The Art of Dying by Osho. You can listen, download or read all of these discourses on oshoworld.com.", "content": "The first question:\r\nOsho,\r\nHow can we prepare ourselves for death?\r\nDon’t accumulate anything whatever: power, money, prestige, virtue, knowledge, even the so-called spiritual experiences. Don’t accumulate. If you don’t accumulate you are ready to die any moment, because you have nothing to lose. The fear of death is not really fear of death; the fear of death comes out of the accumulations of life. Then you have too much to lose. You cling to it. That is the meaning of Jesus’ saying: Blessed are the poor in spirit.\r\nI don’t mean become a beggar, and I don’t mean renounce the world. I mean be in the world, but don’t be of the world. Don’t accumulate inside, be poor in spirit. Never possess anything – and then you are ready to die. Possessiveness is the problem, not life itself. The more you possess, the more you are afraid to lose. If you don’t possess anything, if your purity, if your spirit is uncontaminated by anything, if you are simply there alone, you can disappear any moment; whenever death knocks on the door it will find you ready. You are not losing anything. By going with death you are not a loser. You may be moving into a new experience.\r\nAnd when I say don’t accumulate, I mean it as an absolute imperative. I’m not saying don’t accumulate things of this world and go on accumulating virtue, knowledge, and so-called spiritual experiences, visions – no. I am talking in absolute terms: don’t accumulate. There are people, particularly in the East, who teach renunciation. They say, “Don’t accumulate anything in this world because it will be taken away from you when death comes.” These people seem to be basically greedier than the ordinary, worldly people. Their logic is: don’t accumulate in this world because death will take it away, so accumulate something that death cannot take away from you – accumulate virtue, punya; accumulate character, morality, knowledge; accumulate experiences, spiritual experiences, experiences of kundalini, meditation, this and that; accumulate something that death cannot take away from you.\r\nBut if you accumulate, with that accumulation comes fear. Each accumulation brings fear in its own proportion; then you are afraid. Don’t accumulate and fear disappears. I don’t teach you renunciation in the old sense; my sannyas is an absolutely new concept. It teaches you to be in the world and yet to be not of it. Then you are always ready.\r\n\r\nI have heard about a great Sufi mystic, Abraham Adam. Once he was the Emperor of Bokhara, then he left everything and became a Sufi beggar. When he was staying with another Sufi mystic he was puzzled because every day the man was continuously complaining of his poverty.\r\nAbraham Adam said to him, “The way you abuse it, it may be that you have bought your poverty cheaply.”\r\n“How stupid you must be!” the man retorted, not knowing to whom he was talking, not knowing that Abraham was once the emperor. He said, “How stupid you must be to think that one buys poverty.”\r\nAbraham replied, “In my case, I paid my kingdom for it. I would even give away a hundred worlds for a single moment of it, for every day its value becomes more and more to me. No wonder then that I give thanks for it while you lament it.”\r\n\r\nThe purity of the spirit is the real poverty. The word sufi comes from an Arabic word safa. Safa means purity. Sufi means one who is pure in the heart.\r\nAnd what is purity? Don’t misunderstand me, purity has nothing to do with morality. Don’t interpret it in a moralistic way. Purity has nothing to do with puritans. Purity simply means an uncontaminated state of mind, where only your consciousness is and nothing else. Nothing else really enters into your consciousness, but if you hanker to possess, that hankering contaminates you. Gold cannot enter into your consciousness. There is no way. How can you take gold into your being? There is no way. Money cannot enter into your consciousness. But if you want to possess, that possessiveness can enter into your consciousness. Then you become impure. If you don’t want to possess anything you become fearless. Then even death is a beautiful experience to pass through.\r\nA man who is really spiritual has tremendous experiences, but he never accumulates them. Once they have happened he forgets about them. He never remembers, he never projects them into the future. He never says that they should be repeated or that they should happen again to him. He never prays for them. Once they have happened they have happened. Finished! He is finished with them and he moves away from them. He is always available for the new, he never carries the old.\r\nAnd if you don’t carry the old you will find life absolutely new – incredibly, unbelievably new at each step. Life is new, only the mind is old; and if you look through the old mind life also looks like a repetition, a boring thing. If you don’t look through the mind… Mind means your past, mind means the accumulated experiences, knowledge and everything. Mind means that through which you have passed, but which you are still hanging onto. Mind is a hang-over, dust from the past covering your mirrorlike consciousness. Then when you look through it everything becomes distorted. Mind is the faculty of distortion. If you don’t look through the mind you will be ready for death. In fact not looking through the mind you will know that life is eternal. Only mind dies – without mind you are deathless. Without mind nothing has ever died; life goes on and on and on forever. It has no beginning and no end.\r\nAccumulate – then you have a beginning, and then you will have an end.\r\nThis is the way, how to prepare yourself for death. When I say “how to prepare for death,” I don’t mean preparing for the death that will come in the end – that is very far away. If you prepare for it you will be preparing for the future and again the mind will come in. No, when I say prepare for death, I don’t mean the death that will come finally; I mean the death that visits you every moment with each exhalation. Accept this death each moment and you will be ready for the final death when it comes.\r\nStart dying each moment to the past. Clean yourself of the past each moment. Die to the known so that you become available to the unknown. With dying and being reborn each moment you will be able to live life and you will be able to live death also.\r\nAnd that’s what spirituality is really all about: to live death intensely, to live life intensely; to live both so passionately that nothing is left behind unlived, not even death. If you live life and death totally, you transcend. In that tremendous passion and intensity of life and death, you transcend duality, you transcend the dichotomy, you come to the one. That one is really the truth. You can call it godliness, you can call it life, you can call it truth, samadhi, ecstasy, or whatsoever you choose.\r\n\r\nThe second question:\r\nOsho,\r\nAt times you seem to intend to confuse us about love and meditation. Sometimes you stress the ultimate futility of love; on other occasions you pronounce meditation as being useless. And sometimes you say both love and meditation are fundamental paths of enlightenment.\r\nThe questioner says, “At times you seem to intend to confuse us.” No, you have not listened to me well. I am always confusing, not only at times. Confusion is my method.\r\nWhat I am trying to do by confusing you is to uproot you from your mind. I would not like you to have any roots in the mind in the name of love or in the name of meditation or in the name of God. Your mind is very cunning. It can thrive on anything; on meditation, on love, it can thrive. The moment I see that your mind is thriving on anything, I immediately have to uproot you from it. My whole effort is to create a no-mind state in you. I am not here to convince you about anything. I am not here to give you a dogma, a creed to live by. I am here to take all creeds away from you because only then will life happen to you. I am not giving you anything to live by, I am simply taking all props away from you, all crutches.\r\nThe mind is very clever. If you say, “Drop money,” the mind says, “Okay. Can I cling to meditation?” If you say to the mind, “Renounce the world,” the mind says, “Okay. Can I now possess spiritual experiences?” If you say, “Renounce the world,” the mind says, “I can renounce the world, but now I will cling to the idea of God.” And nothing is a greater barrier to godliness than the idea of God.\r\nThe word God has become a great barrier, the belief in God has become a great barrier. If you want to reach to godliness you will have to drop all ideas about God, all beliefs about God – Hindu, Christian, Mohammedan. You will have to be absolutely silent, unclinging, not-knowing. In that profound ignorance godliness reveals itself to you – only in that profound ignorance.\r\nMy effort is totally different from your effort. What you are doing here is diametrically opposite to what I am doing here. My effort is to create a profound ignorance in you, so I will have to confuse you. Whenever I see that some knowledge is being gathered, I immediately jump on it and destroy it. By and by you will learn – being close to me you are bound to learn – that it is futile to accumulate because this man will not leave you in peace. If you cling to something he is going to take it away, so what is the point? One day you will simply listen to me, not clinging, not making any belief out of it, not creating a philosophy, a theology out of it; simply listening as you listen to the birds, as you listen to the wind passing through the pines, as you listen to the river rushing toward the ocean, as you listen to the wild roar of the ocean waves. Then you don’t create a philosophy, you simply listen.\r\nLet me be a wild ocean roaring in front of you, or a wind passing through the trees, or birds singing in the morning. I am not a philosopher, I am not imparting knowledge to you. I am trying to point to something which is beyond knowledge.\r\nSo the moment I see that you are nodding, the moment I see that you are saying, “Yes, this is true,” the moment I see that you are accumulating something, immediately I have to jump upon it and contradict it to confuse you. Confusion is my method; I am doing it all the time. I will not leave you to rest unless you drop that whole effort of philosophizing, unless you start listening to me without any mind – out of the sheer joy of it, as you listen to music. When you start listening to me in that way then you will never feel confused. You feel confused because first you cling to something, then in the next step I destroy it. You feel confused. You were making a house and again I come there and destroy it.\r\nYour confusion is in fact created by yourself. Don’t create that house, then I cannot destroy it. If you create, I am going to destroy. If you stop creating houses – card-houses, they are – if you stop creating houses, if you say, “This man will come and destroy,” if you simply wait and listen and you don’t bother to make any house to live in, then I cannot confuse you. And the day I cannot confuse you will be a great day of rejoicing for you because that very moment you will be able to understand me, not by your intellect but by your being. It will be a communion, not a communication. It will be a transfer of energy, not of words. You will have entered into my house.\r\nI will not allow you to create any house because that will be a barrier. Then you will start living in that house and I am trying to bring you into my house. Jesus says to his disciples, “In my God’s house there are many mansions.” I also say to you, “I am taking you on a journey to where a great palace is waiting for you.” But I see you making houses by the side of the road and I have to destroy them, otherwise your journey will be destroyed and you will never reach the goal. You start worshipping anything. You are in such a hurry, you are so impatient, that whatsoever I tell you, you simply grab it.\r\nI am not going to allow it to happen. So, be alert. If you are alert there will be no need to confuse you. In fact, if you are alert, whatsoever I do I cannot confuse you. The day you can say, “Now, Osho, you cannot confuse me. Whatsoever you say I listen, I rejoice in it, but I don’t make any conceptualization” is the day I cannot confuse you. Until that moment I am going to confuse you again and again and again.\r\n\r\nThe third question:\r\nOsho,\r\nAs sex is closely related to death, what is the meaning of spontaneous celibacy?\r\nSex is more closely related to birth than to death. Birth is out of sex; birth is a sexual phenomenon. Naturally, sex is also closely related to death – but as a by-product. Because birth is out of sex, death is also going to be out of sex. Hence the nonsensical idea arose in the East that if you remain celibate, if you remain a brahmachari, if you go beyond sex, you will never die – you will become an immortal. That is foolish, because death is not something that is going to happen in the future, it has already happened with birth. You cannot avoid it. You can indulge in sex or you can indulge in celibacy, it is going to make no difference.\r\n\r\nMulla Nasruddin had completed his hundredth year, and a few journalists came to interview him. He was the first citizen of his town who had become a centenarian. They asked how he had attained to such great age.\r\nHe said, “I never touched wine, I was never interested in women. That must be the reason for it.”\r\nImmediately something in the next room fell very loudly and there was a racket. The journalists became very alert. They said, “What is going on?”\r\nMulla said, “It must be my dad. It seems he is again running after the maid, and he seems to be drunk.”\r\nThe old man must be one hundred and twenty-five. Mulla had said, “I have attained to this age because of celibacy and because I never touched any wine, I have remained away from women,” but here is his father still rushing, drunk, trying to catch hold of a woman.\r\n\r\nDeath has already happened the moment you became incarnated in the body. The moment you entered the womb, death has already happened. Your clock, the clock of your life, can run only so far – seventy years, eighty years – it depends on a thousand and one things. But your clock can only run so far. It makes no difference how you live your life, death is going to happen. Death cannot be avoided.\r\nThe questioner has asked: “As sex is closely related to death what is the meaning of spontaneous celibacy?”\r\nThe first thing is: birth and death are both related to sex, but just by becoming celibate you are not going to transcend death. Death has already happened in birth, there is no way to transcend it. It is going to happen because in fact it has already happened. It is only a question of time unfolding. You are rushing toward it each moment.\r\nSo don’t try to be celibate just to avoid death, because that too again is fear. The people who try to become celibate are afraid of death, and one who is afraid of death can never know what death is, can never know what deathlessness is. So don’t be afraid.\r\nAnd celibacy can only be spontaneous. You ask: “What is the meaning of spontaneous celibacy?” Celibacy can only be spontaneous; there is no other type of celibacy. If it is not spontaneous, it is not celibacy. You can force it, you can control your sexuality, but that is not going to help. You will not be celibate, you will be only more and more sexual. Sex will spread all over your being. It will become part of your unconscious. It will move your dreams, it will become your motivation in dreams, it will become your fantasy. In fact, you will become more sexual than you were ever before. You will think more about it and you will have to repress it again and again. And whatsoever is repressed has to be repressed again because the victory is never complete.\r\nThere is no way to destroy sex by force, by violence. There is no way to control and discipline it. The people who have tried to control and discipline it have made the whole world very pornographic. Your so-called saints have a very pornographic mind. If a window can be created and a hole can be made in their heads, you will be able to see just sex, pornography. It is bound to be so. It is natural.\r\nNever enforce any celibacy on yourself. Try to understand what sexuality is, go deep into it. It has a tremendous beauty of its own. It is one of the profoundest mysteries of life. Life comes out of it – it has to be a great mystery. Sex is not sin; repression is a sin. Sex is very natural, very spontaneous. You have not done anything to have it, it is inborn, it is part of your being. Don’t condemn it, don’t judge it, don’t fear it, don’t fight with it. Simply go into it more – more meditatively. Let it happen in such silence, in such deep acceptance, that you can know the very core of it. The moment you penetrate to the very core of sexual orgasm, by and by you will see sex is losing its appeal for you, your energy is moving in a higher plane, you are becoming more loving and less sexual. And this happens spontaneously.\r\nI am not saying become more loving. I am saying that if you go deep into the mystery of sex, love arises out of it naturally. You become more loving and sexuality becomes less and less and less. And one day there is just a pure flame of love, all the smoke of sex has disappeared. The crude energy of sex has been transformed into a more subtle perfume – the perfume of love.\r\nThen I will say go deep into love. If you go deep into love, again you will come to the very core of it. And in that moment prayerfulness will arise. That too happens spontaneously. In sex you are more concerned with the body; in love you are more concerned with the psyche; in prayerfulness you suddenly become concerned with the soul. These are the three possibilities hidden in the seed of sex. And when sex has disappeared into love and love has disappeared into prayerfulness, there is a spontaneous celibacy.\r\nThe Indian term for it is very beautiful. It is brahmacharya. The word literally means living like a god. Brahmacharya means living like a god. The whole energy is just prayerfulness, the whole energy is just a grace, a gratitude, a benediction. One becomes absolutely divine.\r\nBut I am not saying that sex is not divine; it is the seed. Love is the tree, prayer is the flowering. Prayer arises out of sex energy. You have to be grateful toward it, you have to respect it. Sex should be respected because everything is going to happen out of it. Life has happened out of it; death is going to happen out of it; love, prayer and godliness are going to happen out of it. Sex carries the whole blueprint of your destiny. To me, sex is not just sex, sex is all.\r\nSo if from the very beginning you take an “anti” attitude you will be missing the whole journey of life. And you will get involved in such a fight which leads nowhere, you will get involved in a fight in which your defeat is certain. You cannot defeat sexual energy because in sexual energy godliness is hidden, in sexual energy love and prayer are hidden. How can you defeat it? You are very tiny and sexual energy is very universal. This whole existence is full of sexual energy.\r\nBut the word sex has become so condemned. It has to be taken out of the mud. It has to be cleaned. A temple has to be made around it. And remember, celibacy can only be spontaneous, there is no other type of celibacy. It is not a control, it is not a discipline; it is a tremendous understanding of your own energies and their possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe fourth question:\r\nOsho,\r\nYou said nobody should dictate what you should do with your life. How does that fit with being available and surrendering to you?\r\nIn the first place I am a nobody. Now listen to the question again. “You said nobody should dictate what you should do with your life.” And the second thing: don’t surrender to me because I dictate to you. But if you feel like surrendering, what can I do? If you feel like surrendering, it is your feeling. If I am dictating to you to surrender to me, don’t listen to me. But if your heart is dictating, then what are you going to do? If I tell you to be available to me, don’t listen at all. But if your own understanding says, “Be available to this man,” then be.\r\nAnd here there is nobody. If you look deeply into me you will not find anybody there. The house is empty, the whole space is yours, just for the asking. I am just a space. The man you see here sitting in the chair died long before. There is no entity who can dictate anything to you.\r\nJust last night one woman seeker was saying, “I would like to do what other sannyasins are doing, but I cannot surrender. I cannot lose my freedom. I have lived in many confinements from my very childhood, in many disciplines. Now I am afraid to get involved in another imprisonment.” I said, “Don’t be worried. I confer freedom upon you, an absolute freedom.”\r\nSannyas is freedom. If you understand rightly, it is absolute freedom. And the woman understood the point because I said, “Now you are afraid that you may get into another trap. But are you aware that your ego itself can become the trap, and the greatest of all?” You have lived within many other commitments and you found they all became imprisonments – but your own ego can become the imprisonment.\r\nWhen you surrender to a nobody he cannot imprison you, and the very danger of your own ego becoming an imprisonment for you disappears. When you surrender to me you are not really surrendering to me, because I am not here. And I’m not enjoying your surrender at all – whether you surrender or not makes no difference to me. In fact, when you surrender to me, you surrender yourself. You don’t surrender to me, you simply surrender your ego. I am just a device, an excuse. It will be difficult for you to go and surrender to the river, or to the sky, or to the stars – it will be very difficult and you will look a little ridiculous. So I pretend to be here just to help you so that you don’t feel ridiculous. You can put your ego here. There is nobody to receive it and nobody to be happy about it, but it helps.\r\nBuddha used to call such things devices – upaya. It is just an upaya, a device to help those who cannot put their egos down unless they find some feet. I make my feet available to you, but inside there is nobody.\r\n\r\nThe fifth question:\r\nOsho,\r\nWhy do you give us these religious titles? They seem absurd. Outside the ashram Indians seldom call me swami with a straight face.\r\nYou must be hankering for it. I have not called you swami to be swami for others. The word swami means lord. Don’t hanker for others to call you lord. I have called you swami just to indicate your path – so that you become lord of yourself. It is not to make others slaves to you; it is just to make a master of you. The word swami is intended for self-mastery. So don’t feel frustrated if nobody calls you swami. In fact if somebody calls you swami be alert, because there is danger. You may start thinking that you are a swami, you may start thinking that you are some holy man or something. Don’t carry that type of nonsense. I am not here to make you holy or saintly or anything.\r\nYou ask why I give you these religious titles because they seem absurd. They are! Really my whole intention is to make you so ridiculous, so absurd, that others laugh at you and you can also laugh at yourself. That is the whole trick in it.\r\nAnd also for another purpose I call you swami. I give you these religious titles because to me the profane and the sacred are not two separate things; the profane is the sacred, the ordinary is the extraordinary, and the natural is the super-natural.\r\nGod is not somewhere away from the world. God is in the world, immanent. That’s my whole approach: that everything is divine as it is. The old concept of a religious man is that he is anti-life. He condemns this life, this ordinary life – he calls it mundane, profane, illusion. He denounces it. I am so deeply in love with life that I cannot denounce it. I am here to enhance the feeling for it.\r\nWhen I give you these religious titles I am not making you in any way superior to others. Don’t carry any idea of “holier than you,” don’t carry any idea of that sort. That is stupid.\r\nI give you these orange clothes. These clothes have been used for centuries down through the ages for a specific purpose – to make a demarcation between the ordinary life and the religious life. I want to dissolve all those differences. Hence I give you these robes and I don’t take you away from life.\r\nYou will be sitting in ordinary life, working in ordinary life, walking in ordinary life. You will be in the marketplace, you will be in the shop or in the factory, you will be a laborer, a doctor, an engineer. I am not making you special in any way – because that very desire to become special is irreligious.\r\nAnd I have given you these robes to destroy the whole concept completely. That’s why the traditional sannyasins are very much against me. I am destroying their whole superiority. Now sooner or later there will be no distinction. My swamis are growing so fast that the old traditional swamis will be simply lost in the jungle of my swamis. And people will not know who is who. That’s the purpose behind it. I want to make religious life ordinary life, because this is the only life there is. All else is just an ego trip. And this life is so beautiful, there is no need to create another life superior to it.\r\nGo deeper into it, move deeper into it, and profounder depths will be revealed to you. This ordinary life is carrying tremendous possibilities. So I don’t want you to become religious in the sense that others are not religious. I want to drop all distinctions between the profane and the sacred, between the holy and the unholy. It is a great revolution. You may not even be aware of what is happening.\r\nAnd if the traditionalists are against me, I can understand. I am destroying their whole “holier than you” attitude. That’s why I have chosen the orange particularly. That has been the traditional dress for sannyasins. But I have chosen only the dress; nothing else is there in you – nothing else of the traditional discipline. There is just awareness, a love for life, a respect for life, a reverence for life. I have given you the orange robe. The day I see that now the traditional distinction has been destroyed, I will free you from the orange robe. There is no need then. But it will take time because they have been creating the distinction for centuries.\r\nYou cannot conceive of what is happening. When an orange-robed sannyasin walks with his girlfriend on the street, you cannot conceive what is happening. It has never happened in India, not for ten thousand years. People cannot believe it – and you are expecting that they should call you swami? It is enough that they are not killing you! You are destroying their whole tradition. A sannyasin was one who would never look at a woman. Touching was out of the question – and holding the hand, impossible! That was enough to throw him into hell.\r\nI have made you a totally new kind of sannyasin. It is a neo-sannyas. And behind whatsoever I am doing there is a method. You may be aware of it or not. I want to destroy the whole traditional attitude. Life should be religious and religion should not have any other life. The distinction between the marketplace and the monastery should not be there. The monastery should be in the marketplace; the divine dimension should become part of everyday life.\r\n\r\nSomebody asked Bokoju, “What do you do? What is your religious discipline?”\r\nHe said, “I live an ordinary life. That is my discipline. When I feel hungry I eat, and when I feel sleepy I sleep.”\r\nYes, this is exactly how it should be.\r\nThe questioner was puzzled. He said, “But I don’t see anything special in it.”\r\nBokoju said, “That is the point. There is nothing special All hankering for the special is of the ego.”\r\nThe questioner was still puzzled. He said, “But this is what everybody else is doing – when hungry they eat, when feeling sleepy they sleep.”\r\nBokoju laughed. He said, “No, when you eat, you do a thousand and one things also. You think, you dream, you imagine, you remember. You are not there just eating. When I eat, I simply eat. Then there is only eating and nothing else. It is pure. When you sleep you do a thousand and one things – you dream, fight, have nightmares. When I sleep I simply sleep, there is nothing else. When sleep is there, there is only sleep. Not even Bokoju exists. When eating is there, there is only eating. Not even Bokoju exists. When there is walking, there is only walking – no Bokoju. There is walking, simply walking.”\r\n\r\nThis is what I would like you to become. Be ordinary, but bring a quality of awareness to your ordinary life. Bring truth to your ordinary life, introduce godliness into your ordinary life. Sleep, eat, love, pray, meditate, but don’t think that you are making or doing something special. And then you will be special. A man who is ready to live an ordinary life is an extraordinary man. Because to be extraordinary, to desire to be extraordinary, is a very ordinary desire. To relax and to be ordinary is really extraordinary.\r\n\r\nThe sixth question:\r\nOsho,\r\nWhy is this life, which has no end and no beginning, so mysterious? Please explain.\r\nNow, not only do I give you absurd answers, you have started asking absurd questions. Why is this life so mysterious? How am I supposed to know? It is so! It is simply a fact. I am not talking about theories. I’m not saying that it is my theory that life is mysterious – then you could ask why. It is simply so. The trees are green. You ask why. The trees are green because they are green. There is no question of why.\r\nIf you can ask why and the question can be answered, then life will not be a mystery. If the why can be answered, then life cannot be a mystery. Life is a mystery because no why is relevant.\r\n“Why is this life, which has no end and no beginning, so mysterious?”\r\nNow you make me feel guilty, as if I am responsible for life having no beginning and no end. It should have. I agree perfectly with you, but what to do? It has no beginning and no end.\r\nI have heard:\r\n\r\nMulla Nasruddin was saying to one of his disciples that life is like a woman. I was surprised, so I listened attentively to what he was saying.\r\nHe was saying, “The man who says he understands women is bragging. The man who thinks he understands them is gullible. The man who pretends to understand them is ambiguous. The man who wants to understand them is wistful. On the other hand, the man who does not say he understands them, does not think he understands them, does not pretend to understand them, does not even want to understand them – he understands them!”\r\n\r\nAnd that’s how life is also. Life is a woman. Try to understand life and you will become a mess. Forget all about understanding. Just live it and you will understand it. The understanding is not going to be intellectual, theoretical; the understanding is going to be total. The understanding is not going to be verbal; it is going to be non-verbal. That is the meaning when we say life is a mystery. It can be lived but it cannot be solved.\r\nYou can know what it is, but you cannot say what it is. That is the meaning of mystery. When we say that life is a mystery, we are saying that life is not a problem. A problem can be solved. A mystery is that which cannot be solved; insolubility is inbuilt. And it is good that life cannot be solved, otherwise what would you do then? Just think of it. If life is not a mystery and somebody comes and explains it to you – then what will you do? There will be nothing left except to commit suicide. Even that will look meaningless.\r\nLife is a mystery; the more you know it, the more beautiful it is. But the less you know – a moment comes when suddenly you start living it, you start flowing with it. An orgasmic relationship evolves between you and life, but you cannot figure out what it is. That’s the beauty of it, that’s its infinite depth.\r\nAnd yes, there is no beginning and no end. How can there be any beginning to life and any end to life? Beginning will mean that something came out of nothing, and end will mean that something was there and went into nothing. That will be an even bigger mystery. When we say life has no beginning, we simply say it has always been there. How can there be a beginning? Can you mark a line and say that at this moment life started? – as Christian theologians used to say. Just four thousand years before Jesus Christ, they say, life started on a certain Monday. Of course, it must have been in the morning. But how can you call it Monday if there was no Sunday before it? And how can you call it morning if there was no night before it? Just think of it.\r\nNo, you cannot make a mark – that is foolish. It is not possible to mark a line because even to mark a line something is needed. Something is needed to precede it, otherwise demarcation is not possible. You can mark a line if there are two things, but if there is only one thing, how can you mark a line? The fence around your house is possible because there is a neighbor. If there is no neighbor, nothing beyond your fence, the fence cannot exist. Just think of it. If there is absolutely nothing beyond your fence, your fence will fall down into nothing. How can it exist? Something is needed beyond the fence to hold it.\r\nIf on a certain Monday life started, a Sunday is needed to precede it. Otherwise the Monday will fall, topple down and disappear. And in the same way there is no possibility of any end. Life is, life simply is. It has been, it will be. It is eternity.\r\nAnd don’t start thinking about it. Otherwise you will be missing it, because all the time that you waste in thinking about it, is simply waste. Use that time, use that space, use that energy to live it.\r\n\r\nThe seventh question:\r\nOsho,\r\nWhy do you prefer to call meditation the art of dying rather than calling it the art of growing?\r\nBecause I know your ego will like it very much if I called it the art of growing. The art of dying comes like a shock.\r\nLet me tell you an anecdote:\r\n\r\nOne day Mulla Nasruddin saw a crowd gathered around a pond. A Muslim priest with a huge turban on his head had fallen into the water, and was calling for help. People were leaning over and saying, “Give me your hand, Reverend, give me your hand!” But the priest didn’t pay attention to their offer to rescue him. He kept wrestling with the water and shouting for help.\r\nFinally Mulla Nasruddin stepped forward: “Let me handle this!” He stretched out his hand toward the priest and shouted at him, “Take my hand!” The priest grabbed Mulla’s hand and was hoisted out of the pond.\r\nPeople were very surprised and asked Mulla for the secret of his strategy. “It is very simple,” he said. “I know this miser would not give anything to anyone, not even his hand. So instead of saying, ‘Give me your hand’ I said, ‘Take my hand, your Reverence.’ And sure enough, he took it.”\r\n\r\nI know you would like it to be called the art of growing. Then your ego would feel perfectly good: “So it is a question of growth; so I am going to remain and grow.” That’s what the ego always wants.\r\nI have knowingly called it the art of dying. Meditation is the art of dying. Then your ego will be shocked.\r\nAnd it is also truer to call it the art of dying, because your ego is not going to grow, your ego is going to die in meditation. These are the only two possibilities: either your ego goes on growing more, it becomes stronger, or it disappears. If your ego goes on growing and becomes stronger and stronger, you are getting more and more into the mud. You are getting more and more into fetters, you are getting more and more into the imprisonment of it. You will be suffocated. Your whole life will become a hell.\r\nThe growth of the ego is a cancerous growth. It is like cancer, it kills you. Meditation is not growth of the ego, it is death of the ego.\r\n\r\nThe eighth question:\r\nOsho,\r\nThe more you talk about death, the greater my desire for life. I have just realized that I have not really lived. While I can understand that life and death come together, there is a yearning inside me that cries out for life, love and passionate intensity. I have discovered I am anguished at the thought of surrendering my unfulfilled desires. Can one give up what one has never had? I feel I would only return to the body again. Illusion or not, to my great amazement I have to admit that I still desire, and I have never felt such hunger.\r\nWhen I say “to die” I really mean to live intensely; I really mean to live passionately. How can you die unless you have lived totally? In total life there is death, and that death is beautiful. In a passionate, intense life, death comes spontaneously – as a silence, as a profound bliss. When I say “to die”, I am not saying anything against life; in fact, if you are afraid of death you will be afraid of life also. That’s what has happened to the questioner.\r\nA man who is afraid of death will be afraid of life also, because life brings death. If you are afraid of the enemy and you close your door, the friend will also be prohibited. And you are so afraid of the enemy that you close the door; the enemy may enter so you close the door for the friend also. And you become so afraid that you cannot open for the friend, because who knows? The friend may turn out to be the enemy. Or, when the door is open, the enemy may enter.\r\nPeople have become afraid of life because they are afraid of death. They don’t live because at the highest points, peaks, death always penetrates into life. Have you watched this happening? Almost the majority of women have lived a frigid life – they are afraid of orgasm, they are afraid of that wild explosion of energy. For centuries women have been frigid; they have not known what orgasm is.\r\nAnd almost the majority of men suffer because of that fear too – ninety-five percent of men suffer from premature ejaculation. They are so afraid of orgasm, there is so much fear, that somehow they want to finish it, somehow they want to get out of it.\r\nAgain and again they go into lovemaking and there is fear. The woman remains frigid and the man becomes so afraid that he cannot stay in that state any longer. The very fear makes him ejaculate sooner than is natural, and the woman remains rigid, closed, holding herself. Now orgasm has disappeared from the world because of the fear. In the deepest orgasm, death penetrates; you feel as if you are dying. If a woman goes into orgasm she starts moaning, she starts crying, screaming. She may even start saying, “I am dying. Don’t kill me!” That actually happens. If a woman goes into orgasm she will start mumbling, she will start saying, “I am dying! Don’t kill me! Stop!” A moment comes in deep orgasm where ego cannot exist, death penetrates. But that is the beauty of orgasm.\r\nPeople have become afraid of love because in love also, death penetrates. If two lovers are sitting side by side in deep love and intimacy, not even talking… Talking is an escape, an escape from love. When two lovers are talking that simply shows they are avoiding the intimacy. Words in-between give distance; with no words distance disappears, death appears. In silence there is death just lurking around – a beautiful phenomenon. But people are so afraid that they go on talking whether it is needed or not. They go on talking about anything, everything – but they cannot keep silent.\r\nIf two lovers sit silently, death suddenly surrounds them. And when two lovers are silent you will see a certain happiness and also a certain sadness – happiness because life is at its peak, and sadness because at its peak death also comes in. Whenever you are silent you will feel a sort of sadness. Even looking at a roseflower, if you are sitting silently and not saying anything about the roseflower, just looking at it, in that silence you will suddenly feel it is there – death. You will see the flower withering, within moments it will be gone, lost forever. Such a beauty, and so fragile! Such a beauty, and so vulnerable! Such a beauty, such a miracle and soon it will be lost forever and it will not return again. Suddenly you will become sad.\r\nWhenever you meditate you will find death moving around. In love, in orgasm, in any aesthetic experience – in music, in song, in poetry, in dance – wherever you suddenly lose your ego, death is there.\r\nSo let me tell you one thing. You are afraid of life because you are afraid of death. And I would like to teach you how to die so that you lose all fear of death. The moment you lose the fear of death you become capable of living.\r\nI am not talking against life. How can I talk against life? I am madly in love with life! I am so madly in love with life that because of it I have fallen in love with death also. It is part of life. When you love life totally how can you avoid death? You have to love death also. When you love a flower deeply, you love its withering away also. When you love a woman deeply, you love her getting old also, you one day love her death also. That is part, part of the woman. The old age has not happened from the outside, it has come from the inside. The beautiful face has become wrinkled now – you love those wrinkles also. They are part of your woman. You love a man and his hair has grown white – you love those hairs also. They have not happened from the outside; they are not accidents. Life is unfolding. Now the black hair has disappeared and the grey hair has come. You don’t reject them, you love them; they are a part. Then your man becomes old, becomes weak – you love that too. Then one day the man is gone – you love that too.\r\nLove loves all. Love knows nothing else than love. Hence, I say, love death. If you can love death it will be very simple to love life. If you can love even death, there is no problem.\r\nThe problem arises because the questioner must have been repressing, must be afraid of life. And then repression can bring dangerous outcomes. If you go on repressing, repressing, one day you will lose all aesthetic sense. You lose all sense of beauty, sense of grace, sense of divinity. Then the very repression becomes such a feverish state that you can do anything which may be ugly.\r\nLet me tell you a beautiful anecdote. Chinmaya has sent this. He sends beautiful jokes:\r\n\r\nA marine is sent to a distant island outpost where there are no women, but there is a large monkey population. He is shocked to see that without exception his fellow marines all make love with the monkeys, and he swears to them that he will never get that horny. They tell him not to be closed-minded. But as the months passed by, the marine can hold out no longer. He grabs the first monkey he can and gets caught in the act by his buddies, who start laughing their heads off.\r\nSurprised, he says to them, “What are you guys laughing at? You keep telling me to do it!”\r\nThey answer, “Yeah, but did you have to pick the ugliest one?”\r\n\r\nIf you repress, the possibility is that you may choose the ugliest life. If you go on repressing, then the very fever is so much that you are not in your consciousness. Then you are almost in neurosis. Before the repression becomes too much, relax, move into life. It is your life! Don’t feel guilty. It is your life to live and love and to know and be. And whatsoever instincts existence has given to you, they are just indications of where you have to move, where you have to seek, where you have to find your fulfillment.\r\nI know that this life is not all – a greater life is hidden behind it. But it is hidden behind it. You cannot find that greater life against this life; you have to find that greater life only by indulging deeply in this life. There are waves on the oceans. The ocean is hidden just behind the waves. If, seeing the turmoil and the chaos and you escape from the waves, you will be escaping from the ocean and its depth also. Jump in; those waves are part of it. Dive deep and waves will disappear, and then there will be the depth, the absolute silence of the ocean.\r\nSo this is my suggestion for the questioner. You have waited long, now no more. Enough is enough.\r\nLet me tell you an anecdote, an old Italian joke:\r\n\r\nThe Pope’s personal waiter was delivering His Holiness’ breakfast, when he slipped and threw the food all over the floor. “Godammit!” he screamed as he fell.\r\nHis Holiness came out of the door of his room and said, “No cursing in here, my son. Say instead, Ave Maria.”\r\nThe following morning as he attempted to deliver His Holiness’ breakfast, the waiter slipped again, throwing the food on the floor. “Godammit!” screamed the poor man.\r\n“No, my son,” said the Pope. “Ave Maria.”\r\nOn the third day the waiter was trembling with fear, but this time he remembered. “Ave Maria!” he yelled out as soon as he started falling with the breakfast on the floor.\r\n“No!” exclaimed the Pope. “Godammit! This is my third day of skipping breakfast! Enough is enough!”\r\n\r\nIt is your life. There is no need going on skipping breakfast every day. And twice Ave Maria is good, but when it comes finally, it is Godammit!\r\n\r\nThe last question:\r\nOsho,\r\nI am a piece of rock in the middle of the mountain. Even this I don't dare to realize. I dream instead. Osho, why did you tell me about rivers, the ocean and the sky? And how could you give me sannyas? I am a piece of rock in the middle of the mountain.\r\nEverybody is a piece of rock. Unless you attain to your uttermost glory, you are bound to be a piece of rock. But nothing is wrong in being a piece of rock. Because the piece of rock is nothing but existence fast asleep, snoring. A piece of rock is godliness asleep. Nothing is wrong in the piece of rock, it has to be awakened. Hence, I have given you sannyas.\r\nYou say, “And how could you give me sannyas?”\r\nSannyas is nothing but an effort to wake you, an effort to shake you, an effort to shock you into awareness. Sannyas is nothing but an alarm.\r\n“Even this I don’t dare to realize” – that I am a piece of rock in the middle of the mountain – “I dream instead.”\r\nThat’s how the rock avoids its own growth, the rock avoids its own future – by dreaming. Dreaming is the barrier. By dreaming we are avoiding the reality, by dreaming we avoid the real. It is our escape. You don’t have any other escape. This is the only escape route – dreaming.\r\nWhen you are listening to me, you can dream also. Sitting here you can have a thousand and one thoughts roaming around in your mind. You can think of the future or of the past. You can be for and against what I am saying, you can argue, you can debate with me inside yourself, but then you are missing me. I am a fact here. You need not dream here, you can just be here with me. And tremendous will be the result of it.\r\nBut we go on dreaming. People are dreamers, and that is their way. When they are making love to a woman, then they are dreaming; when they are eating, they are dreaming. When they are walking on the road – they have gone for a walk in the morning, the sun is rising, the day is beautiful, the people are getting up, the life is coming back again – they are dreaming. They are not looking at anything. We go on dreaming. Dreaming functions as a blindfold, and we go on missing the reality.\r\n“Osho, why did you tell me about rivers, the ocean and the sky?”\r\nBecause those are your possibilities. The rock can fly; the rock can grow wings. I myself was a rock once, then I started growing wings – so I know. I know your possibility, you may not know it. Hence I talk about the rivers, the ocean and the sky. The rock can become a flower, the rock can become a river, the rock can become the ocean, the rock can become the sky – infinite are your possibilities! Your possibilities are as many as the possibilities of existence. You are multi-dimensional.\r\nThat’s why I go on talking about the rivers and the ocean and the sky. Some day or other a great thirst will possess you, a new passion will arise for the impossible and you will be able to fly into the sky. It is yours, claim it! You only look like a rock. Rocks also only look like rocks. If they make a little effort, if they shake themselves a little, they will find wings are hidden there. They will find infinite possibilities opening, doors upon doors.\r\nBut dreaming functions as the barrier. Being a rock is not the problem: being too much in dreams is the problem. Start dropping dreams. They are futile, meaningless, a wastage and nothing more. But people go on dreaming, go on dreaming… By and by people start thinking that dreaming is their only life. Life is not a dream and dreaming is not life. Dreaming is avoiding life.\r\nLet me tell you an anecdote:\r\n\r\nOn his seventy-fifth birthday, Turtletaub rushed into a physician’s office. “Doctor,” he exclaimed, “I have got a date tonight with a twenty-two-year-old girl. You gotta give me something to pep me up.”\r\nThe MD smiled sympathetically and supplied the old man with a prescription. Later that night, out of curiosity, the medical man phoned his elderly patient, “Did the medicine help?”\r\n“It’s wonderful,” replied Turtletaub. “Seven times already.”\r\n“That’s great,” agreed the doctor. “And what about the girl?”\r\n“The girl?” said Turtletaub. “She didn’t get here yet!”\r\n\r\nDon’t go on dreaming, otherwise you will miss the girl. You will miss life. Stop dreaming, look at that which is. And it is already in front of you. It is already around you, it is within and without. Godliness is the only presence if you are not dreaming. If you are dreaming, then your dreams occupy your inner space. They become the hindrances for godliness to enter into you.

I see their bored, lifeless eyes and pity these sheeple whose lives have been ruined in service of Big Tech profits.\r\n\r\nThis lasts for about thirty seconds before I get bored. The guy next to me chuckles at something on Kanye’s Twitter feed. Wait Kanye? I thought he was off Twitter! In seconds my own phone is out, and I’m furiously scrolling through Reddit, looking for fresh memes.\r\n\r\nAnd so goes the common trope: we all hate our phones, social media, and Netlfix—but we also love them.\r\n\r\nEventually tiring of plain-vanilla bus-ride superiority, I brought a book with me on the bus. Not a Kindle, or an iPad, but a bona fide bound book.\r\n\r\nAfter every sentence or two I would gaze incredulously around the bus with a sneaky grin. These dumb cows, I thought, look at them melt their brains with their stupid social feeds. They can’t focus like I can. I was about to turn back to Sapiens when I noticed a woman in the back of the bus who wasn’t staring at her phone. Nor was she reading a book. She wasn’t even listening to a monotonous NPR podcast.\r\n\r\nThis psychopath was sketching. She had a charcoal pencil and was sketching a human figure. She didn’t look happy exactly. But she looked engaged. She looked intent. And all of a sudden my smugness fled. I realized that reading a book was really just like reading Reddit—both were consumptive activitives.\r\n\r\nWere previous generations really better off because they merely watched TV, or listened to radio, or read books? All of these activities are passive. All of these activities involve letting external thoughts temporarily replace your own. Today’s smartphones differ from medieval books only in degree—all media is created to be consumed.\r\n\r\nI had to start creating.\r\n\r\nCorín Tellado was a Spanish author who wrote over 5,000 books in her 81-year lifespan. That’s over sixty books a year, assuming she came out of the womb fully literate. She claimed she could write a book in two days, and I’m inclined to believe her.\r\n\r\nI can’t write a tweet in two days. Nevertheless, I was inspired by Tellado to stop consuming and start creating. If we categorize all our waking moments as either consumptive or creative, I was probably at a 10:1 ratio, and that’s only if I label “copy/pasting stock images into Keynote presentations” as “creative.” Tellado was probably closer to 1:1. How could I get closer to that?\r\n\r\nOn my next bus ride I pulled out my phone and opened the iOS notes app. I created a new note titled Essay.\r\n\r\nI stared at that off-white screen for several long minutes without typing anything. I don’t have anything to write about, I thought. Also, I’m not even a good writer…maybe I should look online for some tips…\r\n\r\nBut that was a bad idea and I knew it. So I swallowed my pride and just started writing:\r\n\r\n    Why I think creating stuff is a good thing.\r\n\r\n    An essay by Tom C.\r\n\r\nThis was going to be rough.\r\n\r\n    I think people consume too much, and don’t create enough. This is bad I think.\r\n\r\nLike, really rough.\r\n\r\nBut I kept typing; pouring inane, kindergarten-level drivel into my phone.\r\n\r\nThe average person can type about 20 words per minute on a phone. My commute is about 30 minutes each way, so that’s a maximum of 1,200 words a day. Realistically I’m going to have to spend some time thinking about what to write, so let’s be conservative and shoot for 500 words a day.\r\n\r\nI read somewhere that a good blog post is 1,600 words…so if I work fast I could pump one out every three days, right?\r\n\r\nThe first day I wrote 100 horrible words. Really super bad. No one will ever see these words.\r\n\r\nDay two I wrote 80 words. I think I psyched myself out over how bad the previous day went.\r\n\r\nThe third day I only kept writing out of stubbornness. I knew this project was doomed, but I felt like really dooming it.\r\n\r\nBy then end of the first week I had 500 words in the bank. I didn’t feel good about it, but it felt slightly better than scrolling through 47 #AndThatsWhyYouAreMyEx tweets.\r\n\r\nMy essay was garbage. But it was my garbage.\r\n\r\nSo I kept at it, day after day. I once again started feeling smugly superior to my fellow bus riders. Look at me creating, I thought. Look at me contributing to the world, while these reptiles just distract themselves with their phones until they die.\r\n\r\nThis arrogance lasts for a few seconds until I re-read the stream-of-consciousness dogshit I’m typing into my phone.\r\n\r\nI’ve never done sales, but I know a little bit about the “sales funnel.” You hire college grads to make 500 cold calls in a week. Of those 500 calls, maybe 5% agree to watch a demo of the product. Then some slightly-more-senior sales people do this demo, and perhaps 20% of those demos end up in contract negotiation. And 60% of those end up as actual sales. That means you need 500 cold calls to make three sales.\r\n\r\nI think that’s what creating is like. You need to write 500 words to get three good ones. Or 500 sketches, business ideas, or recipes. If you’re really really good, you can increase your overall conversion rate from 0.6% to 1%—but the most reliable way to get better results is to just produce more crap.\r\n\r\nSo I kept at it. week after week. Sometime in the middle of the fourth week I had 3,000 words in my Notes app. That’s when I started editing.\r\n\r\nEditing is hard because you realize how bad you are. But editing is easy because we’re all better at criticizing than we are at creating.\r\n\r\nThe good thing about forcing yourself to produce a bunch of garbage is that you don’t feel bad deleting it. You’re not married to any of your work, because you wrote it half-awake on the 1BX while some crazy dude negotiated his fare with the driver. I gleefully deleted hundreds of words, trying not to think about the neanderthal who must’ve written them.\r\n\r\nIt was exactly a month after I started this creative project that I finished this first essay. I read it over for the bazillionth time and thought this only a small tire fire.\r\n\r\nIn it’s final form, the essay was almost exactly 1,600 words. I called it Consume less, create more.\r\n\r\nYou are, in fact, reading that essay right now. It may not look like it, but this is the product of an entire month of bus rides. If you live in San Francisco and saw someone on the 1BX smashing the face of his phone like he was angry at it, you probably saw me writing this essay.\r\n\r\nPerhaps three people will read this essay, including my parents. Despite that, I feel an immense sense of accomplishment. I’ve been sitting on buses for years, but I have more to show for my last month of bus rides than the rest of that time combined.\r\n\r\nSmartphones, I’ve decided, are not evil. This entire essay was composed on an iPhone. What’s evil is passive consumption, in all its forms.\r\n\r\nTwitter, Facebook, Instagram—we can all agree that these are serious timewasters. But what about The Economist or War and Peace? How much can you really remember from all of those New York Times op-eds you’ve read? Could you summarize the major themes of Grapes of Wrath?\r\n\r\nMost knowledge worth having comes from practice. It comes from doing. It comes from creating. Reading about the trade war with China doesn’t make you smarter—it gives you something to say at dinner parties. It gives you the illusion that you have the vaguest idea what is happening in our enormously complex world.\r\n\r\nA lot of ink has been spilled about the perils of modern technology. How it distracts us, how it promotes unhealthy comparisons with others, how it makes us fat, how it limits social interaction, how it spies on us. And all of these things are probably true, to some extent.\r\n\r\nBut the real tragedy of modern technology is that it’s turned us into consumers. Our voracious consumption of media parallels our consumption of fossil fuels, corn syrup, and plastic straws. And although we’re starting to worry about our consumption of those physical goods, we seem less concerned about our consumption of information.\r\n\r\nWe treat information as necessarily good, and comfort ourselves with the feeling that whatever article or newsletter we waste our time with is actually good for us. We equate reading with self improvement, even though we forget most of what we’ve read, and what we remember isn’t useful.\r\n\r\nSo stop reading and start creating. Paint, draw, compose, code, or plan. It will be hard. It will be slow. It will be frustrating. But I promise it will be worth it.", "created_on": "2024-02-09T04:49:28Z", "tags": "#blog #consume #life #philosophy", "thumbnail": "thumbnails/humanoid_rbW4n2t.jpg", "to_wrap": true, "font": "inherit", "font_size": 0.6, "color": "#ffffff", "background": "#222222", "font_weight": 100, "animation": 1, "shuffle_colors_by_line": true, "shuffle_fonts_by_line": true}}, {"model": "main.parik", "pk": 18, "fields": {"user": 1, "title": "Stop learning - Nash Vail", "description": "Blog link - https://www.nashvail.me/blog/stop-learning", "content": "If I were to pick you and a friend of yours and to you give access to the city planners of Paris, the Instagram handles of its most famous architects-so you can DM them...and I'll make sure they respond. I give you the most detailed maps of the city, the exact opposite of what Apple Maps would give you. I bring for you every encyclopedia entry about Paris ever, every book and every tour guide ever written about Paris. And to your friend? I just drop her in Paris with a task to explore every nook and cranny of it.\r\n\r\nAfter two months, which one of you will be a better Parisian? As in which one of you will know Paris better?\r\n\r\nI recently finished reading Turning Pro. There's this one idea in the book that had me pondering long after I had flipped the book close. I'd like to discuss that idea with you.\r\n\r\nTurning Pro\r\nTurning Pro\r\n\r\nIn Turning Pro, Steven Pressfield— the author— talks about something called incapacity. Incapacity starts with addiction. Addiction not just to substance, but to love, to distraction, to sex, to failure, money or trouble. To quote exact words from the book:\r\n\r\nAll addictions share two primary qualities:\r\n\r\n    They embody repetition without progress.\r\n    They produce incapacity as a payoff.\r\n\r\nLet's take trouble for example. The individual addicted to trouble will never get out of jail because he is safer behind the bars. When you're behind the bars you don't have to deal with the agonizing questions of existence, or embracing and materializing your dreams and visions. Being behind the bars produces for the prisoner incapacity.\r\n\r\nMany people, some of whom I know personally, obsessively chase for love. They know in their soul that what they are actually after, is meaning. They choose to extract that meaning from love, hopping from one failed relationship to the next. Because when you’re busy finding that one love which will bring meaning to your existence you don’t have to worry about spending arduous hours honing your craft or bettering your career or finding meaning in something that only you are in control of. Such a behavior exudes an addiction to love, which is not to say that love is a bad thing, but its addiction definitely is. Such an addiction produces, incapacity.\r\n\r\nWhen you take this kind of addiction and put it in the context of the endless flow of knowledge on the internet, you will begin to see a similar pattern. On the internet, or because of it, people get addicted to learning, following one tutorial after another, taking one course after another, one article after another, one \"micro/centi/nano degree\" after another that does nothing but produce incapacity and repetition without any real progress.\r\n\r\nI remember having projects in hand, things to write, design and build. Instead of getting to work and finishing those, at several occasions I have chosen to take an online course or follow a tutorial or read through an article all of which were supposed to teach me how to build/design/write the said thing.\r\n\r\nSo why is that bad? You see, it's not, it becomes bad when you continue learning even when you know enough. Even when you're capable of jumping right into the project and figure things along the way, you keep delaying it. Beginning something new is uncomfortable, therefore instead you choose to read an article or take a course just so you can tell yourself that you're working, but in reality, you're just looping, you're not making any progress on the project.\r\n\r\nYou can be in the back seat and travel to a place a hundred times. But until you take the driver's seat you'll never know the way. You’ve got to at one point stop taking directions and just go. Magic happens when you get your hands dirty.\r\n\r\nLooking at this way, and I digress, you'll agree that by signing up for college you're essentially buying for yourself 4 years of incapacity. In college, you don't have to worry about forcing your way into your industry or making connections or finding a fulfilling job. You’re safe inside the campus because you’re working on a degree that will somehow magically give you the aforementioned things, which spoiler alert!....\r\n\r\nIt's a different thing when you don't know what you want to do with your life yet, in that case, college gives you enough breathing room to figure that out but if you do and you still choose to not skip college, you're just an incapacity hugging coward. Okay, that was a little too extreme, don't take my advice on college I am just salty because I couldn't complete mine. Now, getting back to the agenda.\r\n\r\nWhat was your answer to the question I asked at the beginning? Who'll be a better Parisian? You reading books or your friend roaming around in Paris. It's common sense, to know Paris, you have to be in Paris, on the streets eating dust. Because if you don't, you will miss the synergy and the magic that happens when you’re in the arena. You have to get out there.\r\n\r\nclosing cover\r\n\r\nOften I have to interview people for engineering and design roles. More often than not all I find on their profiles are Udacity Nanodegrees, College degrees, Udemy course certificates and a myriad of other certifications with 0 real-world projects. That’s when I know that this person is soaked in incapacity to their bones. They won't take charge, they are not brave enough to face the discomfort of starting, creating something new and sending it out to the world.\r\n\r\nAre you addicted to learning? Ask yourself this. It's time to do magic, close the browser, leave the shore, jump off the cliff, cut the rope, pull the pin, pick up the pen, open your journal. Stop learning.

Then we’re supposed to post something about it. Somewhere.\r\n\r\nFrom businesses we’ve never heard of, to countries we’ve never visited, to infants who’ve had the random misfortune to be born into a family that’s on TV – it’s all grist for obvious jokes and shortsighted commentary that, for at least a few minutes, helps both the maker and the consumer feel a little less bored, a little less vulnerable, and a little less disconnected. For a minute, anyway, it makes us feel more alive. Does me, anyway.\r\n\r\nBut, in my observation, the long-term effect of each of these can be surprisingly different.\r\n\r\nWhat makes you feel less bored soon makes you into an addict. What makes you feel less vulnerable can easily turn you into a dick. And the things that are meant to make you feel more connected today often turn out to be insubstantial time sinks – empty, programmatic encouragements to groom and refine your personality while sitting alone at a screen.\r\n\r\nDon’t get me wrong. Gumming the edges of popular culture and occasionally rolling the results into a wicked spitball has a noble tradition that includes the best work of of Voltaire, Dorothy Parker, Oscar Wilde, and a handful of people I count as good friends and brilliant editors. There’s nothing wrong with fucking shit up every single day. But you have to bring some art to it. Not just typing.\r\n\r\nWhat worries me are the consequences of a diet comprised mostly of fake-connectedness, makebelieve insight, and unedited first drafts of everything. I think it’s making us small. I know that whenever I become aware of it, I realize how small it can make me. So, I’ve come to despise it.\r\n\r\nWith this diet metaphor in mind, I want to, if you like, start eating better. But, I also want to start growing a tastier tomato – regardless of how easy it is to pick, package, ship, or vend. The tomato is the story, my friend.\r\n\r\nThis doesn’t mean I’ll be liveblogging a lot of ham-fisted attempts to turn “everything” off. But it does mean making mindful decisions about the quality of any input that I check repeatedly – as well as any “stuff” I produce. Everything. From news sources to entertainment programming, and from ephemeral web content down to each email message I decide to respond to. The shit has to go, inclusive.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I don’t have a specific agenda for what I want to do all that differently, apart from what I’m already trying to do every day:\r\n\r\n    identify and destroy small-return bullshit;\r\n    shut off anything that’s noisier than it is useful;\r\n    make brutally fast decisions about what I don’t need to be doing;\r\n    avoid anything that feels like fake sincerity (esp. where it may touch money);\r\n    demand personal focus on making good things;\r\n    put a handful of real people near the center of everything.\r\n\r\nAll I know right now is that I want to do all of it better. Everything better. Better, better.\r\n\r\nTo underscore, I have no plan to stop making dick jokes or to swear off ragging people who clearly have it coming to them. It’s just that it’s important to me to make world-class dick jokes and to rag the worthy in a way that no one is expecting. I want to become an evangelist for hard work and editing, and I want to get to a place where it shows in everything that I do, make, and share. Yes, even if it makes me sound like a fancy guy who just doesn’t get it. Fuck it.\r\n\r\nSo, yes. I am cutting way back on trips to the steam table of half-finished, half-useful, half-ideas that I both make and consume. And, with respect, I encourage you to consider doing the same; especially if that all-you-can-eat buffet of snark and streaming produces (or encourages) anything short of your “A” game.\r\n\r\nIf I’m not laughing at your joke, complimenting your insight, or leading the Standing O for something you spent 10 seconds pecking up on your phone, it may not be because I don’t get it; it may be because I think we’re both capable of better and just need to find the courage to say so.

school, my nine year old son told me he couldn't wait to get home to write more of the story he was working on. This made me as happy as anything I've heard him say — not just because he was excited about his story, but because he'd discovered this way of working. Working on a project of your own is as different from ordinary work as skating is from walking. It's more fun, but also much more productive.\r\n\r\nWhat proportion of great work has been done by people who were skating in this sense? If not all of it, certainly a lot.\r\n\r\nThere is something special about working on a project of your own. I wouldn't say exactly that you're happier. A better word would be excited, or engaged. You're happy when things are going well, but often they aren't. When I'm writing an essay, most of the time I'm worried and puzzled: worried that the essay will turn out badly, and puzzled because I'm groping for some idea that I can't see clearly enough. Will I be able to pin it down with words? In the end I usually can, if I take long enough, but I'm never sure; the first few attempts often fail.\r\n\r\nYou have moments of happiness when things work out, but they don't last long, because then you're on to the next problem. So why do it at all? Because to the kind of people who like working this way, nothing else feels as right. You feel as if you're an animal in its natural habitat, doing what you were meant to do — not always happy, maybe, but awake and alive.\r\n\r\nMany kids experience the excitement of working on projects of their own. The hard part is making this converge with the work you do as an adult. And our customs make it harder. We treat \"playing\" and \"hobbies\" as qualitatively different from \"work\". It's not clear to a kid building a treehouse that there's a direct (though long) route from that to architecture or engineering. And instead of pointing out the route, we conceal it, by implicitly treating the stuff kids do as different from real work. [1]\r\n\r\nInstead of telling kids that their treehouses could be on the path to the work they do as adults, we tell them the path goes through school. And unfortunately schoolwork tends to be very different from working on projects of one's own. It's usually neither a project, nor one's own. So as school gets more serious, working on projects of one's own is something that survives, if at all, as a thin thread off to the side.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit sad to think of all the high school kids turning their backs on building treehouses and sitting in class dutifully learning about Darwin or Newton to pass some exam, when the work that made Darwin and Newton famous was actually closer in spirit to building treehouses than studying for exams.\r\n\r\nIf I had to choose between my kids getting good grades and working on ambitious projects of their own, I'd pick the projects. And not because I'm an indulgent parent, but because I've been on the other end and I know which has more predictive value. When I was picking startups for Y Combinator, I didn't care about applicants' grades. But if they'd worked on projects of their own, I wanted to hear all about those. [2]\r\n\r\nIt may be inevitable that school is the way it is. I'm not saying we have to redesign it (though I'm not saying we don't), just that we should understand what it does to our attitudes to work — that it steers us toward the dutiful plodding kind of work, often using competition as bait, and away from skating.\r\n\r\nThere are occasionally times when schoolwork becomes a project of one's own. Whenever I had to write a paper, that would become a project of my own — except in English classes, ironically, because the things one has to write in English classes are so bogus. And when I got to college and started taking CS classes, the programs I had to write became projects of my own. Whenever I was writing or programming, I was usually skating, and that has been true ever since.\r\n\r\nSo where exactly is the edge of projects of one's own? That's an interesting question, partly because the answer is so complicated, and partly because there's so much at stake. There turn out to be two senses in which work can be one's own: 1) that you're doing it voluntarily, rather than merely because someone told you to, and 2) that you're doing it by yourself.\r\n\r\nThe edge of the former is quite sharp. People who care a lot about their work are usually very sensitive to the difference between pulling, and being pushed, and work tends to fall into one category or the other. But the test isn't simply whether you're told to do something. You can choose to do something you're told to do. Indeed, you can own it far more thoroughly than the person who told you to do it.\r\n\r\nFor example, math homework is for most people something they're told to do. But for my father, who was a mathematician, it wasn't. Most of us think of the problems in a math book as a way to test or develop our knowledge of the material explained in each section. But to my father the problems were the part that mattered, and the text was merely a sort of annotation. Whenever he got a new math book it was to him like being given a puzzle: here was a new set of problems to solve, and he'd immediately set about solving all of them.\r\n\r\nThe other sense of a project being one's own — working on it by oneself — has a much softer edge. It shades gradually into collaboration. And interestingly, it shades into collaboration in two different ways. One way to collaborate is to share a single project. For example, when two mathematicians collaborate on a proof that takes shape in the course of a conversation between them. The other way is when multiple people work on separate projects of their own that fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. For example, when one person writes the text of a book and another does the graphic design. [3]\r\n\r\nThese two paths into collaboration can of course be combined. But under the right conditions, the excitement of working on a project of one's own can be preserved for quite a while before disintegrating into the turbulent flow of work in a large organization. Indeed, the history of successful organizations is partly the history of techniques for preserving that excitement. [4]\r\n\r\nThe team that made the original Macintosh were a great example of this phenomenon. People like Burrell Smith and Andy Hertzfeld and Bill Atkinson and Susan Kare were not just following orders. They were not tennis balls hit by Steve Jobs, but rockets let loose by Steve Jobs. There was a lot of collaboration between them, but they all seem to have individually felt the excitement of working on a project of one's own.\r\n\r\nIn Andy Hertzfeld's book on the Macintosh, he describes how they'd come back into the office after dinner and work late into the night. People who've never experienced the thrill of working on a project they're excited about can't distinguish this kind of working long hours from the kind that happens in sweatshops and boiler rooms, but they're at opposite ends of the spectrum. That's why it's a mistake to insist dogmatically on \"work/life balance.\" Indeed, the mere expression \"work/life\" embodies a mistake: it assumes work and life are distinct. For those to whom the word \"work\" automatically implies the dutiful plodding kind, they are. But for the skaters, the relationship between work and life would be better represented by a dash than a slash. I wouldn't want to work on anything that I didn't want to take over my life.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's easier to achieve this level of motivation when you're making something like the Macintosh. It's easy for something new to feel like a project of your own. That's one of the reasons for the tendency programmers have to rewrite things that don't need rewriting, and to write their own versions of things that already exist. This sometimes alarms managers, and measured by total number of characters typed, it's rarely the optimal solution. But it's not always driven simply by arrogance or cluelessness. Writing code from scratch is also much more rewarding — so much more rewarding that a good programmer can end up net ahead, despite the shocking waste of characters. Indeed, it may be one of the advantages of capitalism that it encourages such rewriting. A company that needs software to do something can't use the software already written to do it at another company, and thus has to write their own, which often turns out better. [5]\r\n\r\nThe natural alignment between skating and solving new problems is one of the reasons the payoffs from startups are so high. Not only is the market price of unsolved problems higher, you also get a discount on productivity when you work on them. In fact, you get a double increase in productivity: when you're doing a clean-sheet design, it's easier to recruit skaters, and they get to spend all their time skating.\r\n\r\nSteve Jobs knew a thing or two about skaters from having watched Steve Wozniak. If you can find the right people, you only have to tell them what to do at the highest level. They'll handle the details. Indeed, they insist on it. For a project to feel like your own, you must have sufficient autonomy. You can't be working to order, or slowed down by bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nOne way to ensure autonomy is not to have a boss at all. There are two ways to do that: to be the boss yourself, and to work on projects outside of work. Though they're at opposite ends of the scale financially, startups and open source projects have a lot in common, including the fact that they're often run by skaters. And indeed, there's a wormhole from one end of the scale to the other: one of the best ways to discover startup ideas is to work on a project just for fun.\r\n\r\nIf your projects are the kind that make money, it's easy to work on them. It's harder when they're not. And the hardest part, usually, is morale. That's where adults have it harder than kids. Kids just plunge in and build their treehouse without worrying about whether they're wasting their time, or how it compares to other treehouses. And frankly we could learn a lot from kids here. The high standards most grownups have for \"real\" work do not always serve us well.\r\n\r\nThe most important phase in a project of one's own is at the beginning: when you go from thinking it might be cool to do x to actually doing x. And at that point high standards are not merely useless but positively harmful. There are a few people who start too many new projects, but far more, I suspect, who are deterred by fear of failure from starting projects that would have succeeded if they had.\r\n\r\nBut if we couldn't benefit as kids from the knowledge that our treehouses were on the path to grownup projects, we can at least benefit as grownups from knowing that our projects are on a path that stretches back to treehouses. Remember that careless confidence you had as a kid when starting something new? That would be a powerful thing to recapture.\r\n\r\nIf it's harder as adults to retain that kind of confidence, we at least tend to be more aware of what we're doing. Kids bounce, or are herded, from one kind of work to the next, barely realizing what's happening to them. Whereas we know more about different types of work and have more control over which we do. Ideally we can have the best of both worlds: to be deliberate in choosing to work on projects of our own, and carelessly confident in starting new ones.", "created_on": "2024-02-14T09:53:34Z", "tags": "#yc #hackernews # blog #startups", "thumbnail": "thumbnails/parikar_mBICXI8.png", "to_wrap": true, "font": "inherit", "font_size": 0.6, "color": "#ffffff", "background": "#222222", "font_weight": 100, "animation": 1, "shuffle_colors_by_line": true, "shuffle_fonts_by_line": false}}, {"model": "main.channel", "pk": 1, "fields": {"owner": 1, "channel_name": "Humanoid", "about": "Default Channel", "url": "https://parikar.org", "thumbnail": "thumbnails/humanoid.jpg", "created_on": "2024-02-07T15:22:54.534Z", "is_active": true}}, {"model": "main.channel", "pk": 2, "fields": {"owner": 2, "channel_name": "Archive.org", "about": "Archive.org Content", "url": "https://archive.org", "thumbnail": "thumbnails/archive.png", "created_on": "2024-02-07T15:22:43.474Z", "is_active": true}}, {"model": "main.channel", "pk": 3, "fields": {"owner": 3, "channel_name": "Osho", "about": "Discourses of Osho", "url": "https://oshoworld.com", "thumbnail": "thumbnails/osho.jpeg", "created_on": "2024-02-07T15:22:34.717Z", "is_active": true}}, {"model": "main.channel", "pk": 4, "fields": {"owner": 4, "channel_name": "Paul Graham Essays", "about": "Essays of Paul Graham", "url": "https://paulgraham.com", "thumbnail": "thumbnails/paul.jpeg", "created_on": "2024-02-07T15:22:26.363Z", "is_active": true}}, {"model": "main.channelsubscriber", "pk": 18, "fields": {"channel": 3, "subscriber": 1, "subscribed_on": "2024-02-08T16:03:13.492Z", "is_active": false}}, {"model": "main.channelsubscriber", "pk": 20, "fields": {"channel": 4, "subscriber": 1, "subscribed_on": "2024-02-17T08:14:59.519Z", "is_active": true}}, {"model": "main.channelsubscriber", "pk": 21, "fields": {"channel": 2, "subscriber": 1, "subscribed_on": "2024-02-08T01:33:32.236Z", "is_active": true}}, {"model": "main.instantparik", "pk": 1, "fields": {"user": 1, "url": "https://behavioralscientist.org/ive-been-thinking-daniel-dennett-what-if-im-wrong/", "title": "", "description": "https://behavioralscientist.org/ive-been-thinking-daniel-dennett-what-if-im-wrong/", "content": "I used to be a much more conscientious scholar than I am now. I would encounter a journal article or book that was relevant to my interests but forbiddingly technical (or, if the author was a philosopher, just forbiddingly badly written, convoluted, and jargon packed), and I would beat my head against it for hours and hours, running down and checking out all the references—a time-consuming library job in the old days before internet links. I made it something of a point of honor to arrive at a state of confident understanding; I kept at it until I owned that argument. Now I give such candidates for my attention a quick skim, remembering that life is short and if this novelty is worth understanding, somebody I trust will soon explain it to me in terms I can readily digest. These days I almost always outsource the hard work of comprehension when I encounter difficulties, and the policy works wonders—for me.\nDistributed understanding is a real phenomenon, but you have to get yourself into a community of communicators that can effectively summon the relevant expertise. I don’t know if other philosophers have the same policy; many of them seem to me to spend their whole careers working largely alone and grappling with a few narrow issues, voluntarily giving themselves tunnel vision. Perhaps, I think, they cannot do otherwise, given their training. After all, many scientists are in similar trenches. I once asked a promising young neuroscientist, after I’d spent hours watching him run experiments on monkeys with chronically implanted electrodes, what he thought the implications of his research might be, and his answer was “Oh Dan, I don’t have time to think!”\nAll my early due diligence was probably good for me. It got me to confront the difficulty of the questions, seeing with my own eyes the pitfalls that trap many very smart and conscientious thinkers. This injected a small dose of modesty into my growing confidence that I had found—and partly invented—a prodigious explanation-device that reliably devoured difficulties, day after day. The insights (if that is what they were) that I had struggled so hard to capture in my dissertation and my first book have matured and multiplied, generating answers to questions, solutions to problems, rebuttals to objections, and—most important—suggestions for further questions to ask with gratifying consilience. I just turn the crank and out they pour, falling into place like the last pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Perhaps my whole perspective is a colossal mistake—some of my critics think so—and perhaps its abundant fruits are chimeras.\nWhat if I’m wrong? Good thinkers frequently ask themselves this question, the way good doctors frequently check their practices against the Hippocratic oath they swore, and not just as a formulaic ritual.\nWhat if I’m wrong? Good thinkers frequently ask themselves this question, the way good doctors frequently check their practices against the Hippocratic oath they swore.\nMy favorite chapter of Mark Twain’s Adventures of Tom Sawyer tells of Tom’s brilliant stunt of getting his friends to pay him for the privilege of whitewashing the fence in front of his house, not just saving him a chore but enriching him. This inspired me to adopt the same strategy with my books: I invite Tufts students to help me write my books by sharing the penultimate draft with them in a seminar, where they are all encouraged to point out errors, challenge arguments, demand more clarity, and in general complain about anything that strikes them as amiss. They don’t get paid for this excellent editorial service—in fact they are paying one of the highest rates of tuition in the country—but they do get thanked in the preface by name, and they get an autographed copy of the book when it’s published. I believe everyone involved has been quite content with this arrangement.\nI particularly cherish the intrepid naysayers who force me to expand, revise, or drop what I had thought were good points. Students often come to my office to discuss their term-paper projects in my courses, and a familiar combination of ambition and anxiety is the enthusiastic student who has a Big Idea—a Refutation of some well-regarded claim of mine or of some other writer we have read. They’re itching to go for it, but “What if I’m wrong?” I have some not-quite-foolproof advice: take courage and set out to write up the Great Discovery; if after many hours of red-hot thinking and writing you discover to your dismay a fatal flaw, something that you overlooked or underestimated, all is not lost. Go back to the first paragraph and write something along the lines of “It is tempting to think that . . . , because there seems to be a powerful argument to the effect that . . . , but as we shall see, this is an error.” Then make a few minor adjustments to the rest of the paper, pointing carefully to the error that you almost made, and you’re ready to submit it. If your Big Idea was tempting to you, it might well be tempting to others. Showing the field that this is a cul-de-sac to be avoided is a genuine contribution. The same strategy, writ large, is good advice for a whole career. Try your Big Hunch out on a few knowledgeable people; if nobody can knock it down right away, then take a leap, make a major investment of your time (bearing in mind the large cost of lost opportunities if you make a bad choice) and hope for the best. You may at least be able to salvage a definitive refutation of your hunch, all the more credible for having been composed by somebody who was initially a partisan.\nTake courage and set out to write up the Great Discovery; if after many hours of red-hot thinking and writing you discover to your dismay a fatal flaw . . . all is not lost. Go back to the first paragraph and write something along the lines of “It is tempting to think that . . . ”\nThe Discovery Institute is the well-funded propaganda site for Intelligent Design, as creationism is now called. I have often scoffed publicly at the dismal ratio of propaganda to peer-reviewed science in its output and urged its directors to put their money into some real science that might, conceivably, prove them right. So when they announced in 2005 that they were setting up a serious research facility, the Biologic Institute, to do experiments aiming to refute the theory of evolution by natural selection, they asked me to express my opinion of this innovation. I wrote back that I applauded this move, since there are scads of unasked questions in evolutionary biology that are neglected by biologists simply because they’re sure they already know the answer: How did species X with feature Y come to be? It evolved, of course, but we don’t know the details. Nobody wants to sic a graduate student or postdoc on any of those questions, because the reaction among the influential workers in the field to the results would be along the lines of “Ho hum, what else is new?”—not a good way to start a career. If, however, the Biologic Institute wants to fund young scientists who are passionately committed to disproving evolution, this will harness their energy and training without our having any scruples about encouraging them to waste their precious time. They will see themselves as crusaders on a divine mission, and what could be more glorious than that? They will try to find hidden among these unasked questions embarrassing examples of “irreducible complexity” that couldn’t have evolved gradually. They will eventually discover that they’re wrong, and we will have yet further examples of evolution’s devious paths. In my terminology, their dogged search for skyhooks will uncover heretofore unimagined cranes. And precisely because their conclusions will be the opposite of what they hoped to discover, we will take them seriously. Good theories thrive on serious attempts to refute them that fail in instructive ways.\nWhat, though, if my supposed insights are just generated by a prodigiously fertile mistake? It’s worth remembering that this has happened before, on a cosmic scale. Descartes wrote his retrospectively preposterous books—Le Monde (eventually published in full in 1667) and Principia Philosophiae (1644)—presenting the first detailed TOE (theory of everything). He had deduced (he claimed) the truth about everything under the sun and beyond the sun, including starlight and planets, tides, volcanoes, magnets, and much, much more, most of it dead wrong. It was Newton’s majestic Principia (1687) that decisively refuted Descartes. Descartes’s theory of everything is, even in hindsight, remarkably coherent and persuasive. It is hard to imagine a different equally coherent and equally false theory! He was wrong, and so of course I may well be wrong, but enough other thinkers I respect have come to see things my way that when I ask myself, “What if we are wrong?” I can keep this skeptical murmur safely simmering on a back burner.\nAdapted from I’ve Been Thinking.

When David Armitage posted this recipe for pancakes in the Bodleian collection on Twitter, I knew that I wanted to try it. These rich, nutmeg-scented pancakes are absolutely delicious. (Many thanks to Rhae Lynn Barnes and the other readers who immediately sent this recipe my way.)\nIn Philip Long’s catalog of the collection at the Bodleian, he notes that this recipe, and a few others, were written by Locke: “A collection of twelve recipes dated 1675-94, of which three (fols. 85, 89, 91) are in Locke’s hand” (2). The next time I visit Oxford for research, I will be excited to see this recipe as well as the eleven others in this set of miscellaneous papers.\nOriginal Recipe\nOxford, Bodleian Libraries MSS. Locke c. 25, fol. 85. (Photo from David Armitage)\npancakes\nTake sweet cream 3/4 + pint. Flower a\nquarter of a pound. Eggs\nfour 7 leave out two 4 of\nthe whites. Beat the Eggs very well. Then put in\nthe flower, beat it a quarter of an hower. Then\nput in six spoonfulls of the Cream, beat it a litle\nTake new sweet butter half a pound. Melt it to oyle, &\ntake off the skum, power in all the clear by degrees\nbeating it all the time. Then put in the rest of\nyour cream. beat it well. Half a grated nutmeg\n& litle orangeflower water. Frie it without butter.\nThis is the right way\nFrom the start, I was intrigued by the cross-outs and other notes in the recipe. It appears that it was first drafted (or prepared) using significantly fewer eggs. The modifier “new” was added before “sweet butter” at some point. Locke may have written the final note “This is the right way” as part of the initial draft or after the recipe was prepared. Locke was attentive to the details of separating and whisking eggs as well as adding just the right amount of orange blossom water (“litle”) and nutmeg (“Half a grated nutmeg”) – an exceptional, expensive amount.\nLike the other seventeenth- and eighteenth-century pancakes that I’ve tried, these fall somewhere between crêpes and American pancakes: They’re a bit fluffier and fattier than a classic French crêpe and have far less rise than my favorite American breakfast version. My spouse, Joseph, described Locke’s pancakes as somewhere between a classic English pancake and a Scotch pancake (or Scottish pancake).\nMany of the commenters on Twitter balked at the instruction to beat the eggs and flour for a “quarter of an hower.” These extended mixing times, however, are common in early modern recipes. While I did prepare my version using a hand-held mixer to ensure thorough beating, I did reduce the mixing time to avoid over-mixing which can lead to a chewy pancake. From what I know about historical and contemporary flour milling, this would not have been a concern for Locke or his cook.\nUpdated Recipe\nMakes approximately 10 8-inch pancakes\n1 cup butter (2 sticks, 1/2 lb, 226g)\n3 whole eggs plus 4 additional egg yolks\n1 cup flour (1/4 lb, 113g)\n1 1/2 cups heavy cream\n1 Tablespoon orange blossom water\nhalf a nutmeg, grated\nFirst, melt the butter.

Add the remaining cream and orange blossom water and stir to combine. Grate 1/2 a nutmeg and stir into batter.\nHeat a frying pan or skillet on a high heat until a drop of water skitters across the surface. Lower the heat to medium.\nPour approximately half a cup of batter into the center of the pan and spread by swirling the pan to create an 8-inch pancake. Cook for 1 minute or until the edges of the pancake lift and appear lacy and the middle looks mostly set. Flip the pancake and cook for an additional 30 seconds.\nRepeat until your batter is gone. Serve the pancakes immediately.\nThe Results\nBetween the rich dairy and the fragrant nutmeg, these pancakes made for a decadent breakfast. When Locke wrote down, and perhaps prepared this recipe, the eggs, cream, butter, and flour would all have been ingredients ready to hand in many households. The addition of so much nutmeg and a dash of orange blossom water elevates this specific pancake recipe to a special treat.\nI certainly enjoyed sitting down with a plate of pancakes drizzled with a little bit of honey, a cup of coffee, and an old, heavily annotated copy of Locke that I read for a class that I took more than a decade ago. If you make these pancakes on a future winter morning or as part of your holiday vacation, be sure to let me know.", "created_on": "2024-02-13T08:19:29.287Z", "tags": ""}}, {"model":

चावल से बनी है जिसमें ना केवल मसाले मिलाए गये हैं, साथ ही प्याज़, लहसुन और टमाटर भी। यह इस खिचड़ी को खट्टापन प्रदान करते हैं और स्वाद भी। जब आपके पास कढ़ी बनाने का समय ना हो, आप इस दाल खिचड़ी को केवल दही और पापड़ के साथ परोस सकते हैं और आपके टेबल पर एक स्वादिष्ट खाना तैयार होगा!\nकुछ महत्वपूर्ण बिंदु मैं आपके साथ दाल खिचड़ी रेसिपी पर साझा करना चाहूंगा। 1. प्रेशर कुकर लें और उसमें दाल डालें। हमने तुवर दाल का इस्तेमाल किया है, लेकिन बहुत से लोग मूंग दाल, तुवर दाल या मसूर दाल के संयोजन करके उपयोग करते हैं। 2. हमने अपनी खिचड़ी रेसिपी में टमाटर और प्याज को शामिल किया है, लेकिन आप अपनी पसंद की सब्जियां जैसे हरी मटर, फूलगोभी और आलू को शामिल कर सकते हैं। 3. प्रेशर कुकिंग के दौरान थोड़ा अतिरिक्त पानी डालकर दाल खिचड़ी को थोड़ा नरम बनाना सबसे अच्छा है। 4. जब दाल खिचड़ी को प्रेशर कुकिंग करते हैं, तो हाई फ्लेम पर न पकाएं क्योंकि खिचड़ी प्रेशर कुकर के निचले हिस्से में अटक जाएगी और एक जले हुए स्वाद को दे देगी। इसलिए मध्यम आंच पर पकाएं। 5. आप दाल खिचड़ी स्वस्थ बनाने के लिए चावल को इस रेसिपी में टूटे हुए गेहूं (लापसी या डालिया) से बदल सकते हैं।\nसुनिश्चित करें कि आप अपनी दाल की खिचड़ी को पिघले हुए घी के उदार मात्रा में उपयोग करें।\nनीचे दिया गया है दाल खिचड़ी रेसिपी | खिचड़ी रेसिपी | अरहर दाल

It’s a Formica bookcase, its shelves lined with hundreds of garishly colored screw-top plastic bottles not much taller than shot glasses. Front and center is a Cadillac-red bottle of 5-Hour Energy, the two-ounce caffeine and vitamin elixir that purports to keep you alert without crashing. In eight years 5-Hour has gone from nowhere to $1 billion in retail sales. Truckers swear by it. So do the traders in Oliver Stone’s 2010 sequel to Wall Street. So do hungover students. It’s $3 a bottle, and it has made Bhargava a fortune.\nHis company, Living Essentials, is the biggest player by far in the energy-shot market, and not because 5-Hour is so delicious. Chalky cough syrup is more like it. The reason Bhargava has won is that he plays tough. Sitting in that cemetery are a dozen or so neon copycats with names like 6-Hour Power and 8-Hour Energy. Each has been sued, bullied or kicked off the market by Living Essentials’ lawyers. In front of each are little placards with a skull and crossbones drawn in felt-tip pen. Bhargava points at the gravestone of one of his late competitors and says with a chuckle, “Rest in peace.”\nThe privately held Living Essentials doesn’t report revenue or profits, but a source with knowledge of its financials says the company grossed north of $600 million last year on that $1 billion at retail. The source says the company netted about $300 million. Checkout scan data from research firm SymphonyIRI say that 5-Hour has 90% of the energy-shot market. Its closest competitor, NVE Pharmaceuticals’ Stacker brand, has just over 3%.\nYet Bhargava, 58, is so under the radar that he barely registers on Web searches. His paper trail is thin, consisting primarily of more than 90 lawsuits. This is his first press interview. “I’m killing it right now,” he says, adjusting a black zip-up cardigan from behind the table of a soulless conference room in a beige low-rise building in a suburban business park in Farmington Hills, Mich. “But you’ll Google me and find, like, some lawyer in Singapore.”\nVague and inscrutable is how Bhargava likes things. The names of 5-Hour’s parent company, Living Essentials LLC, and that company’s parent firm, Innovation Ventures, are purposely bland. “They were intended as placeholders, and they stuck,” he says, smiling.\nColleagues and acquaintances uniformly describe Bhargava as “humble,” and he seems proud of his frugal lifestyle: his ancient flip phone, his cheap office furniture, the modest two-story home he shares with his wife and 20-year-old son. Yet, over vegetarian lasagna at Antonio’s, his favorite strip-mall Italian joint off Detroit’s Twelve-Mile Road, Bhargava says, apropos of nothing: “I’m probably the wealthiest Indian in America.”\nThe rise of 5-Hour began in the spring of 2003, when Bhargava found himself at a natural products trade show in Anaheim, Calif. At one booth the sales reps peddled a 16-ounce concoction claiming to boost productivity for hours. Bhargava took a swig. “For the next six or seven hours I was in great shape,” he says. “I thought, Wow, this is amazing. I can sell this.”\nRight away, though, he knew 16 ounces wouldn’t sell. He didn’t want to compete with Red Bull, at the time new to the market. Nor did he want to share fridge space with Coke or Pepsi. “I thought, If I’m tired, am I also thirsty? Is that like having a headache and a stomachache? It didn’t make any sense.” He glanced at the ingredients label and made a mental note. Six months later his version was on the shelves, two ounces of caffeine-infused B vitamins such as niacin mixed with acids like taurine.\nBhargava’s team still had to convince stores and buyers alike that their product was safe. The initial job of getting 5-Hour Energy on the shelves went to Rise Meguiar, Living Essentials’ vice president of sales and the only woman on a team of 17. Health chain GNC was the first to bite, agreeing to stock 5-Hour in 1,200 of its stores in 2004. Slowly but surely, Walgreens, Rite Aid and regional chains like Sheetz followed.\n“It was never an easy sell,” says Meguiar, who aimed from the start to get those little red bottles up at the cash register next to the gum and lighters. “Getting it next to the register isn’t hard. Keeping it there? Very hard. Anything that sells, the stores will try. To own that space is really hard.”\nMeguiar’s greatest coup, one that now accounts for an estimated 15% of 5-Hour’s overall sales: the Wal-Mart checkout aisle. The superstore sells all four 5-Hour flavors in every U.S. store, plus 24-packs at Sam’s Club.\n“What we did wasn’t rocket science,” says Bhargava. “It’s not the little bottle. It’s not the placement. It’s the product. You can con people one time, but nobody pays $3 twice.”\n***\nBhargava was born in India in the prosperous northern city of Lucknow. His parents were well-off, with a villa surrounded by lush, award-winning gardens. They left for America in 1967, so his academic publisher father could get a Ph.D. at Wharton. The family landed hard in West Philadelphia in a third-floor, $80-a-month walk-up with threadbare carpets on seedy 47th Street. They went from having servants in India to splitting one Coca-Cola four ways as a treat.\nTeenaged Bhargava excelled at math. “It’s like in Good Will Hunting,” he says, raising a hand to mime Matt Damon’s chalkboard scrawl of algebraic equations in the film. “You see stuff or you don’t. I just see it.” He had no tuition money, but connived his way into interviews at competitive Philadelphia schools, offering to take math tests to prove himself.\nEarly on he realized he didn’t much care what sort of business he was in as long as he was winning at it. At 17 Bhargava noticed that blocks of low-income homes in the roughest North Philly neighborhoods were being razed and cleared. Bhargava bought a 1.5-ton 1953 Chevy dump truck for $400 and started clearing out debris from the demolition. He’d find rats bigger than cats among the garbage and rubble. “The stench was mind-bending,” he says. He remembers hearing gunshots outside a crumbling house on crime-ridden Girard Avenue and learning an old man had been killed for $5. Still, Bhargava made $600 that summer—and resold the Chevy for $400. He didn’t care if the work was unglamorous. It was profitable.\nHe won a full scholarship to the Ivy League feeder Hill School before heading to college at Princeton in 1972. Bhargava lasted a year. The pretentious eating-club culture wasn’t really for him, and he didn’t find his math classes particularly challenging. “‘Annoyed’ would be a mild word for my parents’ reaction,” he says. He returned to Fort Wayne, Ind., where his parents had settled and his father owned a plastics company. “There were no jobs; it was a disaster,” he says. “It was right before the oil embargo, the stagflation era.” He started reading books about a Hindu saint who’d spent his life on a spiritual quest. That, he thought, was something worthwhile. In 1974 he moved to India.\nBhargava says he spent his 20s traveling between monasteries owned and tended by an ashram called Hanslok. He and his fellow disciples weren’t monks, exactly. “It’s the closest Western word,” he says. “We didn’t have bowler haircuts or robes or bells.” It was more like a commune, he says, but without the drugs. He did his share of chores, helped run a printing press and worked construction for the ashram. Bhargava claims he spent those 12 years trying to master one technique: the stilling of the mind, often through meditation. He still considers himself a member of the Hanslok order and spends an hour a day in his Farmington Hills basement in contemplative silence.\nBhargava would return to the U.S. periodically during his ashram years, working odd jobs before returning to India. For a few months he drove a yellow cab in New York. When he moved back from India for good, it was to help with the family plastics business at his parents’ urging. He spent the next decade dabbling in RV armrests and beachchair parts. He had no interest in plastics whatsoever but devoted himself to buying small, struggling regional outfits and turning them around. By 2001 Bhargava had expanded his Indiana PVC manufacturer from zero sales to $25 million (he eventually sold it to a private equity firm for $20 million in 2006). He decided to retire and moved to Michigan to be near his wife’s family. “Nobody moves on purpose to Detroit,” he says. His retirement lasted two months. He knew from his plastics success that the chemicals industry was ripe for exploiting. “Chemicals are really simple,” he says. “You mix a couple things together and sell it for more than the materials cost.”\nBhargava takes a shot of his creation every morning and another before his thrice-weekly tennis game. He shakes his head at the suggestion that taking shots infused with caffeine is at odds with his quest for inner stillness. “5-Hour Energy is not an energy drink, it’s a focus drink,” he says, turning one of the pomegranate-flavor bottles around in his hands. “But we can’t say that. The FDA doesn’t like the word ‘focus.’ I have no idea why.”\n***\nBhargava claims to be the richest Indian in America—a title that officially belongs to Silicon Valley venture capitalist Vinod Khosla—but trying to untangle Bhargava’s business structure requires a 24-pack of 5-Hour Extra Strength. He could well be worth much more than Khosla’s $1.3 billion. Living Essentials’ closest comparable public company, energy drink giant Monster, trades at over 30 times earnings, making Bhargava easily a multibillionaire on paper.\nBut Bhargava claims to have given away $1 billion in 2009, with a letter to FORBES from his attorney, David Lieberman of the Michigan firm Seyburn Kahn, to back him up. Tax returns of Bhargava’s U.S. charity, the Rural India Supporting Trust, suggest a different narrative. Virtually the entire donation was in the form of a 45% stake in the privately held Living Essentials. Only a few million dollars was in cash.\nRural India then sold that 45% stake to Nevada 5, a private for-profit company. In exchange, Rural India got a note worth $623.6 million. Bhargava’s accountant Paul Edwards of Plante Moran says his client is not a beneficial owner in Nevada 5—but another one of his associates says it is a vehicle for Bhargava’s philanthropy and affiliated with Innovation Ventures, the parent company of Living Essentials.\nThis kind of deal raises questions, says Roger Colinvaux, professor at Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law and an expert on tax and philanthropy. “If it were a private foundation, it would be prohibited from selling to a company related to a major donor.”\nRural India itself appears not to be giving much away. It lists total grants paid out in 2010 of just $4 million off a total asset base that by the end of that year had been stepped up to just over $1 billion. Bhargava can get away with this because he set up Rural India as something called a supporting organization, or a group that financially supports other charities. Unlike a traditional private foundation, a supporting organization has no mandated 5% minimum outlay, pays no excise taxes on investment income and has fewer self-dealing restrictions. Bhargava is not doing anything illegal here, just exploiting a loophole in the tax code many other big philanthropists have used as well.\nIowa Senator Chuck Grassley has been going after supporting organizations since 2002. “This structure permits a donor to donate assets to a charity, which then lends them back to the donor,” Grassley says. “This results in huge tax breaks for the donor with very little money actually going to those in need.”\nThe primary recipient of grants from the Rural India Supporting Trust is an organization called the Hans Foundation, which works to improve the lives of India’s most needy. Hans sends surgeons to combat epidemic levels of cataracts among the rural poor and devotes much-needed funds to women’s health care. A staff of 12 travels India looking for schools and hospitals to adopt rather than build from scratch. “We don’t do the work, but we have money,” Bhargava says.\nBhargava was originally vague and slightly taciturn when asked about the name of the foundation, describing Hans only as a former teacher, now dead. Only later, after much questioning, did he identify Hans as a guru called Shri Hans Ji Maharaj, spiritual leader of the Hanslok ashram where Bhargava spent those years pursuing a life of discipline as a monk. Bhargava talks of his monk days nonchalantly, accompanied by a characteristic dismissive shrug. “It’s a personal thing,” he says. “I don’t want to be a Jehovah’s Witness here proselytizing.”\nWith 5-Hour now growing smoothly, Bhargava is on to the next thing—or three. He’s put most of the $100 million behind Stage 2 Innovations, a Detroit tech venture fund that’s already invested in clean engines, hydroponic farming and water desalination. To run Stage 2 Bhargava hired former Chrysler Group CEO Tom LaSorda, a barrel-chested auto industry veteran as gregarious as the slight, bespectacled Bhargava is reticent. Bhargava wooed LaSorda over a $12 plate of pasta under the dusty grapes hanging from the ceiling at Antonio’s.\n“I said, ‘Hey, if you find any technology, bring it to me,’” says Bhargava. The fund’s first investment is in Hybrid60, a hydraulic engine technology that aims to increase fuel efficiency by 60%. LaSorda is testing it on trucks right now and eventually hopes to sell the technology to customers such as his billionaire buddy Roger Penske, who could retrofit his 225,000 rental trucks, the largest fleet in the U.S.\nAcross the room from their tester Penske truck LaSorda and Bhargava look approvingly at their other project: an indoor, software-controlled farm. Tiny basil plants are growing inside 12-foot-by-12-foot containers that look like giant tanning beds covered in tinfoil. Rows of lilac lights bathe the trays of basil, each pot fed the perfect amount of nutrients at the right pH level. It hums like an air-conditioning unit, a trickle of water barely audible. In two weeks each sapling will be exactly 8 inches tall. The hydroponic startup has set up 500 more of these farm fridges, which do the work of 500 acres of land, in another unused building Bhargava bought on Detroit’s outskirts. He thinks this invention could change agriculture in drought-prone Middle Eastern and African countries.\nLaSorda says he has found himself having to explain who his mysterious partner is on more than one occasion. “The reaction I get is ‘Who’s this guy?’” LaSorda says. “Then I say, ‘The 5-Hour Energy guy,’ and they say, ‘Oh, sh--, he must be killing it.’ I say, ‘Yeah, he is.’”\nRead More: What's In A Bottle Of 5-Hour Energy?", "created_on": "2024-02-13T08:38:46.256Z", "tags": ""}}, {"model": "main.instantparik", "pk": 5, "fields": {"user": 1, "url": "https://antithesis.com/blog/is_something_bugging_you/", "title": "", "description": "https://antithesis.com/blog/is_something_bugging_you/", "content": "Is something bugging you?\nIt’s pretty weird for a startup to remain in stealth for over five years. People ask me why we did that, and my answer is always the same: “We wanted to build something awesome before releasing it out into the wild, and we were lucky enough to be able to do that under the radar while also attracting great hires, finding early customers, and working with investors.” All the same, it’s an unnatural thing for a startup to do. A lot of muscles end up atrophying, including those you use to talk to the world. Fortunately, we’re going to get a lot of practice at it now, because in those five years we’ve built a lot of stuff – way more than I can tell you about right now. But I can tell you the first part of it.\nWhy We Built This\nSome of you have heard of our last company, FoundationDB. At first glance, Antithesis couldn’t be more different from FoundationDB, but it’s also a continuation of that story in a funny sort of way. When we sat down in 2010 to build a scalable, fault-tolerant distributed database with ACID transactions, most people didn’t even think it was possible.[1] We were agnostic as to whether it was possible or impossible, but we were certain that even under the best circumstances, it would be very hard. And the part that seemed hardest was how on earth you could test or validate such a thing, and how you could gain confidence in its correctness.\nThe fundamental problem of software testing—you might say the fundamental problem of software development—is that software has to handle many situations that the developer has never thought of or will never anticipate. This limits the value of testing, because if you had the foresight to write a test for a particular case, then you probably had the foresight to make the code handle that case too. This makes conventional testing great for catching regressions, but really terrible at catching all the “unknown unknowns” that life, the universe, and your endlessly creative users will throw at you.\nThis isn’t unique to distributed databases: every kind of software has this problem, but a distributed storage system really turns it up to 11. Now you’ve got concurrency, both within each machine and between machines. You’ve got networks, which always seem to be delaying or reordering packets at the worst possible moments, and disks, which are just waiting for you to look away so they can start vomiting all over your data. And then you’ve got all the stuff that can really go wrong—machine failures and power outages and datacenters catching fire and, oh yeah, well-meaning human beings panicking and accidentally making things worse. What’s especially hard about these failure modes is that they’re non-deterministic—you can easily have a catastrophic bug that’s exquisitely dependent on the precise ordering of events across multiple machines in a cluster. Even if your tests find it once, they may never find it again (but don’t worry, your customers will find it for you). And here we were, trying to make a software system that would behave perfectly and maintain its ACID guarantees in the face of all of this. How were we going to do that?\nSo we did something crazy, which turned out to be the best decision we made in the whole history of the company. Before we even started writing the database, we first wrote a fully-deterministic event-based network simulation that our database could plug into. This system let us simulate an entire cluster of interacting database processes, all within a single-threaded, single-process application, and all driven by the same random number generator. We could run this virtual cluster, inject network faults, kill machines, simulate whatever crazy behavior we wanted, and see how it reacted. Best of all, if one particular simulation run found a bug in our application logic, we could run it over and over again with the same random seed, and the exact same series of events would happen in the exact same order. That meant that even for the weirdest and rarest bugs, we got infinity “tries” at figuring it out, and could add logging, or do whatever else we needed to do to track it down. I gave a talk about this at Strangeloop in 2014, which you can watch here.\nAnyway, we did this for a while and found all of the bugs in the database. I know, I know, that’s an insane thing to say. It’s kind of true though. In the entire history of the company, I think we only ever had one or two bugs reported by a customer. Ever. Kyle Kingsbury aka “aphyr” didn’t even bother testing it with Jepsen, because he didn’t think he’d find anything.\nIt was a good database. But actually, this is not the cool part of the story.\nHere is the cool part of the story. The cool part is what happened after we found all the bugs in the database. You see, once you’ve found all the bugs in something, and you have very powerful tests which can find any new ones, programming feels completely different. I’ve only gotten to do this a few times in my career, and it’s hard to convey the feeling in words, but I have to try. It’s like being half of a cyborg, or having a jetpack, or something. You write code, and then you ask the computer if the code is correct, and if not then you try again. Can you imagine having a genie, or an oracle, which just tells you whether you did something wrong? The closest comparison I have is the way some people talk about programming in Haskell or in Rust, where after half an hour of siege warfare against the compiler, it agrees to build something, and you can be confident that it won’t have certain kinds of bugs. But there’s a limit to what a compiler can tell you. I love me a powerful type system, but it’s not the same as actually running your software in thousands and thousands of crazy situations you’d never dreamed of.\nAt FoundationDB, once we hit the point of having ~zero bugs and confidence that any new ones would be found immediately, we entered into this blessed condition and we flew. Programming in this state is like living life surrounded by a force field that protects you from all harm. Suddenly, you feel like you can take risks. We did crazy stuff. We deleted all of our dependencies (including Zookeeper) because they had bugs, and wrote our own Paxos implementation in very little time and it had no bugs. We rewrote the entire transaction processing subsystem of our database to make it faster and more scalable – a bonkers thing to do btw – and the project was shockingly not a debacle, and oh yeah it had no bugs. We had built this sophisticated testing system to make our database more solid, but to our shock that wasn’t the biggest effect it had. The biggest effect was that it gave our tiny engineering team the productivity of a team 50x its size.\nIn 2015, Apple acquired FoundationDB and began using it as the “underpinning of their cloud infrastructure” (that’s a direct quotation from Apple, so they can’t sue me), and then open sourced it a few years later. As our team began to disperse throughout other big tech companies, we were shocked to find that even in these sophisticated organizations, nothing like FoundationDB's deterministic simulation testing existed. The near-impossibility of anticipating unintended system impacts meant that changes to their backend systems happened at a snail's pace, and diagnosing and fixing production bugs consumed months of extremely valuable time from some of their most senior engineers.\nSo I called up my friend and former boss Dave Scherer (FoundationDB’s chief architect), and told him: “There’s a $100 bill lying on the sidewalk here man.” Of course, economic theory will tell you that those don’t exist. There’s always a catch, always some horrible reason that the pot of gold is surrounded by corpses. But starting a company is about banishing that thought and telling yourself that when you reach the pit full of poisonous spikes, you’ll figure something out. So in 2018, we started Antithesis with the goal of bringing the superpower of FoundationDB-style deterministic autonomous testing to everybody else.\nWhat We've Built\nSure enough, the $100 bill is surrounded by an entire field of poisonous spike-pits, nay, a continent of them. Here’s an obvious one: how do you take an arbitrary piece of software, which is probably doing stuff like spawning threads, checking the time, asking the kernel for random numbers, and talking to other software over a network, and make it deterministic? At FoundationDB we had the benefit of a green-field project that we knew we wanted to test this way, and we had no dependencies (or at least, we didn’t once we’d deleted them all). But any new software development methodology that requires everybody to rewrite everything from scratch isn’t going to get very far. We thought about this and decided to just go all out and write a hypervisor which emulates a deterministic computer. Consequently, we can force anything inside it to be deterministic. That meant learning lots of fun new things about how Intel CPUs handle extended page tables and other related horrors. It’s a story for another time, but it’s a good example of the kind of poisonous spike-pit we’ve gotten to explore (and it’s far from the worst one!).[2]\nAnyway, we’ve built a platform that takes your software and hunts for bugs in it. When it finds one, that bug is always perfectly reproducible, no matter what crazy thing your software was doing–even if it involves multiple services communicating across a network. Also, once we’ve found a bug, we can bring some relatively space-age and insane debugging capabilities to bear on it. The platform is designed to be able to someday find many kinds of bugs in many kinds of software, but for now, we’re focused solely on distributed systems reliability / fault tolerance testing, because it’s an area where we already know what we’re doing.\nOver the past several years we’ve partnered with engineering teams at a bunch of organizations with big and complicated systems whose reliability they consider critical. We’ve worked with MongoDB for several years, helping them test their core server software as well as their WiredTiger storage engine. We began working with the Ethereum Foundation about a year ahead of the Merge in order to help them test it, and continue working with them today. And we’re working with Palantir—but when I told them I was writing this blog post they just glared at me and said “no comment”, so that’s all I can say about that.\nInitially, these customers thought of Antithesis as a “special forces” tool that primarily helped them find and replicate their most elusive and dangerous bugs. But as our platform has become more mature and interactive, we’ve shifted to being an “always on” service that continuously tests the most recent builds of their software, thus shortening the time from bug introduction to bug discovery. When building FoundationDB, we found that this made diagnosing and fixing bugs dramatically easier, increasing our efficiency and improving our software quality. Our customers are seeing this effect now, and we’re excited to help many more of you reach the ~zero bugs promised land in the years to come.\nGet In Touch?\nIf your organization runs a distributed system and values reliability and engineering productivity, we’d love to talk.\nDo you occasionally walk into a spike pit and say to yourself: “Not bad, but these spikes really aren’t poisonous enough”? If so, please take a look at our open positions.\nIf you’ve got questions or comments, feel free to reach out on\nIf you’ve made it this long – thank you for reading.

A saga that has stretched on for more than five years, through multiple judges, one mistrial, and the death of Lacey's longtime business partner James Larkin. A case premised on a moral panic that previewed tactics threatening to all sorts of speech.\nOne count of international concealment money laundering—that's the only charge of which a jury found Lacey guilty. Lacey's offense? Moving money from a U.S. bank to a Hungarian bank in 2017.\nTransferring money between bank accounts doesn't seem like it should be a crime. Then again, neither does most of the underlying activity in this case—consensual hookups between adults; providing a platform for sex-worker speech; letting people pay for services with bitcoin, and so on.\nThe Department of Justice claimed this was about \"keeping women and children across America safe\" from sex trafficking. But behind that bravado, the government's actual case was clearly something less noble. A performance of protection. A publicity stunt. A massive scapegoating set against the backdrop of a moral panic. And a politicized prosecution against people who engaged in and defended the most dangerous thing to any government: free speech.\nUltimately, the Backpage prosecution was a small-scale tragedy that upended individual lives as well as something much bigger. Its effects were wide-reaching and devastating for many sex workers. And yet—it wasn't ultimately about sexual commerce or sexual crimes, not at its core. This was a warning shot fired at entities that enable all sorts of digital communication and a test bed for further legal attacks on tech companies that won't suppress speech as politicians see fit.\nThat Lacey was convicted of \"international concealment money laundering\" is bizarre, since the money transfer was not concealed: His lawyer informed the IRS about it, as required by law. And it was not made for nefarious purposes, according to Scottsdale lawyer John Becker's trial testimony. Lacey had needed some place to park his savings after U.S. banks, scared by a years-long propaganda crusade against Backpage, had decided doing business with the company or its associates was a reputational risk. So Becker and another lawyer advised Lacey to deposit the money—$17 million, on which taxes had been paid—with a foreign bank.\nIt's hard to see how Lacey conducted a financial transaction \"to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity,\" even if you accept the government's premise that this money was derived from unlawful activity. And, to be clear, I don't accept that premise, since Backpage's business should have been protected by the First Amendment (not to mention Section 230 of federal communications law).\nBut Backpage made money from adult ads, and the government alleges that some of those ads were illegal enticements to prostitution. Therefore, the case alleged, anything done with money made from Backpage was de facto illegal. That's how Lacey—and former Backpage executives Jed Brunst and Scott Spear—wound up facing money laundering charges for merely moving money around.\nThat jurors could only agree to convict Lacey on one out of 86 counts highlights the fundamental bankruptcy of the state's case.\nAnd yet—Lacey, age 75, could still spend the rest of his life in prison on this one count, which carries a possible sentence of up to 20 years in prison.\nMeanwhile, the verdict, handed down in mid-November, still leaves Lacey in limbo, too. While jurors found Lacey not guilty on one count of international promotion of money laundering, they were hung on the more than 80 other counts, leading Judge Diane Humetewa to declare a mistrial on those. That means federal prosecutors could still try again—a third time, that is.\nThe most recent trial was their second attempt. Back in 2021, Judge Susan Brnovich declared the first trial a mistrial because prosecutors and their witnesses wouldn't stop smearing the defendants as human traffickers and child predators, even though none of them faced charges involving children or trafficking.\nLacey, Larkin, Spear, Brunst, and the two other Backpage defendants on trial—operations manager Andrew Padilla and assistant operations manager Joye Vaught—were accused of a conspiracy to facilitate prostitution and various acts in furtherance of this alleged conspiracy.\nBackpage officially banned ads for illegal activity, including ads promising sex in exchange for money. But the feds argued that some such ads got through anyway, and many others were simply coded offers for commercial sex. The Backpage defendants countered that many forms of sex work are legal (as are ads promising or seeking casual sex). Backpage simply provided a forum for advertising these legal activities, and doing so was protected by both the First Amendment and Section 230, which shields web platforms from liability for content created by their users and for content moderation. If people ultimately engaged in illegal activity after posting or responding to Backpage ads, that was on them.\nThe jury disagreed in part. Spear was found guilty of 17 counts of facilitating prostitution, and he and Brunst were both convicted of multiple counts of money laundering and conspiracy crimes.\nHowever, the jury acquitted Padilla and Vaught of all charges.\n\"My client should have never been in this case,\" Vaught's attorney, Joy Bertrand, said. \"She was charged and pressured to cooperate and assist the government, and she had the courage to say no.\"\nIndeed, it seems likely the feds charged Vaught and Padilla in an attempt to get them to turn on Lacey and Larkin. It was Lacey and Larkin—along with CEO Carl Ferrer, who did turn state's evidence in exchange for a plea deal—who launched Backpage, profited most from it, and had the most control, at least in the beginning.\nIt was also Lacey and Larkin who spent decades as journalists and publishers exposing government corruption and opposing everything from the Vietnam War to abortion bans, tough immigration policies, and abuses of police power. And it was Lacey and Larkin who had been fighting government incursions on free speech in court case after court case.\nLacey and Larkin suggested all along that their prosecution was personal, accusing power players like the late Sen. John McCain and his wife Cindy of trying to get revenge for all the times their papers had exposed unflattering facts about them and their associates.\nBut the case has always been deeply political as well, designed to test the limits of Section 230 and free speech online generally.\nBackpage was a test case, chosen because its affiliation with sex workers made it an easy target (a lot of folks are willing to ignore injustice if they think it only affects the wrong kind of people). If the government could get away with doing it to Backpage—that is, demanding control over what sorts of speech the platform allowed, punishing leaders and staff for failing to submit, and using the whole thing as a rallying cry to wrest more regulatory control of online content—they could move on to attacking bigger and more widely-used platforms. And that's exactly what they've done in recent years, going after Twitter, Facebook, and other big tech companies—not to mention \"the internet's First Amendment,\" Section 230, more broadly—using the playbook they perfected with Backpage.\nMoral panic about sex trafficking is the underlying current that made all of this possible.\nThe first two decades of this century have been awash in (unfounded) fear about an alleged epidemic of women and children being forced into sexual slavery—a narrative pushed by people wishing to conflate all sex work with sex trafficking. Activists looking to drum up support for this narrative often zeroed in on escort ads (once easily viewable by anyone who visited the likes of Craigslist, Backpage, or countless other platforms) as \"proof\" that 21st-century America was awash in what they termed modern slavery. For politicians looking to get some good publicity, attacking these platforms was an easy path.\nMeanwhile, political actors of all sorts seized on sex trafficking to push pet schemes, including crackdowns on consensual sexual activity and increasing surveillance of immigrants, online speech, and more. Much like with the war on drugs—which was becoming less and less potent as a ploy for expansions of government power—they seized on this zeitgeist-y boogeyman and used it to expand policing funding, surveillance state powers, and other measures of control. And much of the media, along with others who often style themselves as defenders of free speech, bought—and spread—the government's propaganda, or at least declined to speak against it.\nThe government tried to confuse the public about the Backpage case from the beginning, shouting about sex trafficking whenever possible and crowing about how Backpage's shutdown was a boon for victims. But law enforcement has said otherwise, both in public and in private, and both before and after the site's seizure. Backpage helped police locate victims and prosecutors build cases against perpetrators, and Backpage executives and staff were cooperative in these efforts. Federal prosecutors themselves admitted it in private memos.\nIn fact, the FBI told auditors with the Government Accountability Office that since the site's shutdown, stopping sex trafficking has become more difficult.\nCountless sex workers have talked about how their work has become less safe since Backpage and similar sites were taken down by the feds. And countless others—sex workers and not—have seen an erosion of their right to free speech online, and not just about commercial sexual activity.\nThat's the sad legacy of this prosecution: less accountability for sex traffickers, less safety for people in the sex trade, less free speech online for everybody—and a legal playbook for the government to follow for further invasions of Americans' speech and privacy rights.\nAnd to achieve this outcome, law enforcement officials ran roughshod over myriad individual lives. The Backpage defendants had their assets seized, their reputations smeared, and years of their lives stolen, all so the government could further its sex trafficking charade.\nLacey, Brunst, and Spear may spend the rest of their lives in prison. Larkin took his own life last summer, just before the trial started. It's impossible to say why with certainty, but it was also clear to everyone who knew him that the prosecution had severely beaten him down.\n\"If the government decides to point its finger at you, there's really no question that they're going to try to ruin you,\" and \"given the system and the way it's set up\" they have a good chance of succeeding, Larkin told me last spring. By this point, several of the defendants had to get public defenders as they could no longer afford to pay private lawyers. Much of Lacey's and Larkin's assets had been seized, including money they made long before Backpage, and years of fighting these charges without access to that money was taking a toll. \"They're going to litigate us until we're dry as beef jerky,\" Lacey said then.\nBackpage surely won't be the last website targeted for allowing speech that the government deems undesirable. And what its case shows is how powerful the law enforcement apparatus can be, and how little the protections supposedly afforded by the law and the constitution matter when agents of the state decide to make an example out of you.\nThe government will always have more resources—more money, more time, more allies, more influence, more power.

I see their bored, lifeless eyes and pity these sheeple whose lives have been ruined in service of Big Tech profits.\nThis lasts for about thirty seconds before I get bored. The guy next to me chuckles at something on Kanye’s Twitter feed. Wait Kanye? I thought he was off Twitter! In seconds my own phone is out, and I’m furiously scrolling through Reddit, looking for fresh memes.\nAnd so goes the common trope: we all hate our phones, social media, and Netlfix—but we also love them.\nEventually tiring of plain-vanilla bus-ride superiority, I brought a book with me on the bus. Not a Kindle, or an iPad, but a bona fide bound book.\nAfter every sentence or two I would gaze incredulously around the bus with a sneaky grin. These dumb cows, I thought, look at them melt their brains with their stupid social feeds. They can’t focus like I can. I was about to turn back to Sapiens when I noticed a woman in the back of the bus who wasn’t staring at her phone. Nor was she reading a book. She wasn’t even listening to a monotonous NPR podcast.\nThis psychopath was sketching. She had a charcoal pencil and was sketching a human figure. She didn’t look happy exactly. But she looked engaged. She looked intent. And all of a sudden my smugness fled. I realized that reading a book was really just like reading Reddit—both were consumptive activitives.\nWere previous generations really better off because they merely watched TV, or listened to radio, or read books? All of these activities are passive. All of these activities involve letting external thoughts temporarily replace your own. Today’s smartphones differ from medieval books only in degree—all media is created to be consumed.\nI had to start creating.\nCorín Tellado was a Spanish author who wrote over 5,000 books in her 81-year lifespan. That’s over sixty books a year, assuming she came out of the womb fully literate. She claimed she could write a book in two days, and I’m inclined to believe her.\nI can’t write a tweet in two days. Nevertheless, I was inspired by Tellado to stop consuming and start creating. If we categorize all our waking moments as either consumptive or creative, I was probably at a 10:1 ratio, and that’s only if I label “copy/pasting stock images into Keynote presentations” as “creative.” Tellado was probably closer to 1:1. How could I get closer to that?\nOn my next bus ride I pulled out my phone and opened the iOS notes app. I created a new note titled\nEssay.\nI stared at that off-white screen for several long minutes without typing anything. I don’t have anything to write about, I thought. Also, I’m not even a good writer…maybe I should look online for some tips…\nBut that was a bad idea and I knew it. So I swallowed my pride and just started writing:\nWhy I think creating stuff is a good thing.\nAn essay by Tom C.\nThis was going to be rough.\nI think people consume too much, and don’t create enough. This is bad I think.\nLike, really rough.\nBut I kept typing; pouring inane, kindergarten-level drivel into my phone.\nThe average person can type about 20 words per minute on a phone. My commute is about 30 minutes each way, so that’s a maximum of 1,200 words a day. Realistically I’m going to have to spend some time thinking about what to write, so let’s be conservative and shoot for 500 words a day.\nI read somewhere that a good blog post is 1,600 words…so if I work fast I could pump one out every three days, right?\nThe first day I wrote 100 horrible words. Really super bad. No one will ever see these words.\nDay two I wrote 80 words. I think I psyched myself out over how bad the previous day went.\nThe third day I only kept writing out of stubbornness. I knew this project was doomed, but I felt like really dooming it.\nBy then end of the first week I had 500 words in the bank. I didn’t feel good about it, but it felt slightly better than scrolling through 47 #AndThatsWhyYouAreMyEx tweets.\nMy essay was garbage. But it was my garbage.\nSo I kept at it, day after day. I once again started feeling smugly superior to my fellow bus riders. Look at me creating, I thought. Look at me contributing to the world, while these reptiles just distract themselves with their phones until they die.\nThis arrogance lasts for a few seconds until I re-read the stream-of-consciousness dogshit I’m typing into my phone.\nI’ve never done sales, but I know a little bit about the “sales funnel.” You hire college grads to make 500 cold calls in a week. Of those 500 calls, maybe 5% agree to watch a demo of the product. Then some slightly-more-senior sales people do this demo, and perhaps 20% of those demos end up in contract negotiation. And 60% of those end up as actual sales. That means you need 500 cold calls to make three sales.\nI think that’s what creating is like. You need to write 500 words to get three good ones. Or 500 sketches, business ideas, or recipes. If you’re really really good, you can increase your overall conversion rate from 0.6% to 1%—but the most reliable way to get better results is to just produce more crap.\nSo I kept at it. week after week. Sometime in the middle of the fourth week I had 3,000 words in my Notes app. That’s when I started editing.\nEditing is hard because you realize how bad you are. But editing is easy because we’re all better at criticizing than we are at creating.\nThe good thing about forcing yourself to produce a bunch of garbage is that you don’t feel bad deleting it. You’re not married to any of your work, because you wrote it half-awake on the\n1BX while some crazy dude negotiated his fare with the driver. I gleefully deleted hundreds of words, trying not to think about the neanderthal who must’ve written them.\nIt was exactly a month after I started this creative project that I finished this first essay. I read it over for the bazillionth time and thought this only a small tire fire.\nIn it’s final form, the essay was almost exactly 1,600 words. I called it Consume less, create more.\nYou are, in fact, reading that essay right now. It may not look like it, but this is the product of an entire month of bus rides. If you live in San Francisco and saw someone on the\n1BX smashing the face of his phone like he was angry at it, you probably saw me writing this essay.\nPerhaps three people will read this essay, including my parents. Despite that, I feel an immense sense of accomplishment. I’ve been sitting on buses for years, but I have more to show for my last month of bus rides than the rest of that time combined.\nSmartphones, I’ve decided, are not evil. This entire essay was composed on an iPhone. What’s evil is passive consumption, in all its forms.\nTwitter, Facebook, Instagram—we can all agree that these are serious timewasters. But what about The Economist or War and Peace? How much can you really remember from all of those New York Times op-eds you’ve read? Could you summarize the major themes of Grapes of Wrath?\nMost knowledge worth having comes from practice. It comes from doing. It comes from creating. Reading about the trade war with China doesn’t make you smarter—it gives you something to say at dinner parties. It gives you the illusion that you have the vaguest idea what is happening in our enormously complex world.\nA lot of ink has been spilled about the perils of modern technology. How it distracts us, how it promotes unhealthy comparisons with others, how it makes us fat, how it limits social interaction, how it spies on us. And all of these things are probably true, to some extent.\nBut the real tragedy of modern technology is that it’s turned us into consumers. Our voracious consumption of media parallels our consumption of fossil fuels, corn syrup, and plastic straws. And although we’re starting to worry about our consumption of those physical goods, we seem less concerned about our consumption of information.\nWe treat information as necessarily good, and comfort ourselves with the feeling that whatever article or newsletter we waste our time with is actually good for us. We equate reading with self improvement, even though we forget most of what we’ve read, and what we remember isn’t useful.\nSo stop reading and start creating. Paint, draw, compose, code, or plan.

While the space agency has successfully taken spacecraft to an orbit around the moon three times, this is the first time it has brought anything back.\nThis, in addition to the hop experiment conducted at the end of life of the Chandrayaan-3 lander, gives glimpses of Isro’s preparedness for future missions that would require the spacecraft to not only land successfully on the moon but also take off from it and make its way back to Earth.\nThe current experiment is also the first time the space agency has demonstrated a gravity assist flyby not around Earth but another celestial body. Gravity assist flyby is a technique where gravity of a planet or celestial body is used to redirect, speed up, and slingshot a spacecraft towards Earth.\nThe experiment has also helped Isro test software that can plan such a manoeuvre.\nBringing the propulsion module back to Earth avoids it not only from crashing into the moon at the end of its life, but also from entering geostationary orbit and colliding with other satellites. “Considering the estimated fuel availability and the safety to GEO spacecrafts, the optimal Earth return trajectory was designed for October 2023,” the space agency said.\nThe first manoeuvre of the propulsion module was performed on October 9, increasing the orbit around the moon to 5,112 km from 150 km. This increased the time it takes the spacecraft to go around the moon from 2.1 hours to 7.2 hours. Another manoeuvre was performed on October 13 to increase the orbit to 1.8 lakhs x 3.8 lakhs km. The propulsion module went around the moon four times before exiting its sphere of influence on November 10.\nAt present, the propulsion module is orbiting the Earth at an altitude of about 1.54 lakh km, reaching the altitude of 1.15 llakh kilometres at its closest. The orbit is around 13 days. “As per current orbit prediction, there is no threat of close approach with any operational Earth orbiting satellites,” the space agency said.\nThe payload on-board the propulsion module, called SHAPE, will continue to conduct spectroscopic study of the Earth’s atmosphere from its new orbit. The payload was designed to try to pick up signals that will help scientists understand the markers of life on other planets outside our solar system.\nIndian team faces setback on Day 3 of India vs England 3rd Test as Ashwin withdraws due to family emergency.

Concerns are amplified by Beijing’s ongoing obstruction of any independent investigation into the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19—whether it accidentally leaked from the Wuhan lab performing dangerous gain-of-function research or derived from the illegal trade in racoon dogs and other wildlife at the now-infamous Wuhan wet-market.\nFour years ago, during the early weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak, Beijing failed to report the new virus and then denied airborne spread. At pains to maintain their fiction, Chinese authorities punished doctors who raised concerns and prohibited doctors from speaking even to Chinese colleagues, let alone international counterparts. Chinese medical statistics remain deeply unreliable; the country still claims that total COVID-19 deaths sit at just over 120,000, whereas independent estimates suggest the number may have been over 2 million in just the initial outbreak alone. Now, Chinese doctors are once again being silenced and not communicating with their counterparts abroad, which suggests another potentially dangerous cover-up may be underway.\nWe don’t know exactly what is happening, but we can offer some informed guesses.\nThe microbe causing the surge in hospitalization of children is Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which causes M. pneumoniae pneumonia, or MPP. First discovered in 1938, the microbe was believed for decades to be a virus because of its lack of a cell membrane and tiny size, although in fact it is an atypical bacterium. These unusual characteristics makes it invulnerable to most antibiotics (which typically work by destroying the cell membrane). The few attempts to make a vaccine in the 1970s failed, and low mortality has provided little incentive for renewed efforts. Although MPP surges are seen every few years around the world, the combination of low mortality and difficult diagnostics has meant there is no routine surveillance.\nAlthough MPP is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in school children and teenagers, pediatricians such as myself refer to it as “walking pneumonia” because symptoms are relatively mild. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), influenza, adenoviruses, and rhinoviruses (also known as the common cold) all cause severe inflammation of the lungs and are far more common causes of emergency-room visits, hospitalization, and death in infants and young children. Why should MPP be acting differently now?\nOne contributing factor to the severity of this outbreak may be “immunity debt.” Around the globe, COVID-19 lockdowns and other non-pharmaceutical measures meant that children were less exposed to the usual range of pathogens, including MPP, for several years. Many countries have since seen rebound surges in RSV. Several experts agree with Beijing’s explanation that the combination of winter’s arrival, the end of COVID-19 restrictions, and a lack of prior immunity in children are likely behind the surging infections. Some even speculate that that substantial lockdown may have particularly compromised young children’s immunity, because exposure to germs in infancy is essential for immune systems to develop.\nIn China, MPP infections began in early summer and accelerated. By mid-October, the National Health Commission had taken the unusual step of adding MPP to its surveillance system. That was just after Golden Week, the biggest tourism week in China.\nInfection by two diseases at the same time can make things worse. The usual candidates for coinfection in children—RSV and flu—have not previously caused comparable surges in pneumonia. One difference this time is COVID-19. It is possible that the combination of COVID-19 and MPP is particularly dangerous. Although adults are less susceptible to MPP due to years of exposure, adults hospitalized for COVID-19 who were simultaneously or recently coinfected by MPP had a significantly higher mortality rate, according to a 2020 study.\nInfants and toddlers are immunologically naive to MPP, and unlike COVID-19, RSV, and influenza, there is no vaccine against MPP. It seems implausible that no child (or adult) has died from MPP, yet China has not released any data on mortality, or on extrapulmonary complications such as meningitis.\nMost disturbing, and a fact being downplayed by Beijing, is that M. pneumoniae in China has mutated to a strain resistant to macrolides, the only class of antibiotics that are safe for children less than eight years of age. Beyond discouraging parents to start ad hoc treatment with azithromycin, the most common macrolide and the usual first-line antibiotic for MPP, Beijing has barely mentioned this fact. Even more worrying is that WHO has assessed the risk of the current outbreak as low on the basis that MPP is readily treated with antibiotics. Broader azithromycin resistance in MPP is common across the world, and China’s resistant strain rates in particular are exceptionally high. Beijing’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported macrolide resistance rates for MPP in the Beijing population between 90 and 98.4 percent from 2009 to 2012. This means there is no treatment for MPP in children under age eight.\nFears over a novel pathogen are already abating. After all, MPP is rarely lethal. But antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is. Responsible for 1.3 million deaths a year, AMR kills more people than COVID-19. No country is immune to this growing threat. Since China, where antibiotics are regularly available over the counter, leads the world in AMR, it is inconceivable that this issue hasn’t yet come up, particularly during WHO’s World AMR Awareness week, from Nov. 18 to Nov. 24.\nAny infectious disease physician would want to know: Did WHO asked China the obvious question—what is the level of azithromycin resistance of M. pneumonia in the current outbreak—and include the answer in its risk assessment? Or did it ask about resistance to doxycycline and quinolones, antibiotics that can be used to treat MPP in adults? Even if WHO did ask, China isn’t telling, and WHO isn’t talking.\nChina’s silence isn’t surprising. Its antibiotic consumption per person is ten times that of the United States, and policies for AMR stewardship are predominantly cosmetic. While surveillance is China’s strong point, reporting is not.\nDespite Spring Festival, the Chinese celebration of the Lunar New Year and another peak travel period, approaching in February 2024, WHO hasn’t advised any travel restrictions. It should have learned the danger of accepting Beijing’s statements at face value. Four years ago, Beijing’s delay enabled more than 200 million people to travel from and through Wuhan for Spring Festival. That helped COVID-19 go global. Since China’s AMR rates are already so high, importing AMR from other countries isn’t a major concern for China. Export is the issue, and China’s track record in protecting other countries is abysmal.\nRather than repeating the self-serving whitewashing coming from Beijing, WHO should be publicly pressing China about the threat of mutant microbes. Halting AMR is essential. Before antisepsis and antibiotics, surgery was a treatment of last resort. Without antibiotics, we lose 150 years of clinical and surgical advances. Within ten years, we are at risk of few antibiotics being effective. It may not be the novel virus that people were expecting, but the next pandemic is already here.\nAnnie Sparrow is a practicing clinician in war zones and an associate professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.

He will always break them in seeking more wealth, more attention, or more votes.\n- If reality doesn’t get the ex-president what he wants, he conjures a new one.\n- Trump is compelled always to fight — even when stepping back would be smarter.\n- And when accountability finally arrives, he sees justice as an act of persecution by his enemies.\nThese Trump traits leap out of a staggering 92-page ruling handed down by Engoron, which left Trump facing a half-billion-dollar hole in his finances because of penalties and obligations in this and other cases.\nThe judge encapsulated the former president’s brazen refusal to play by the same rules under which everyone else must live — and that in this case are the key to a functioning banking and economic system — with the words: “ The frauds found here leap off the page and shock the conscience.”\nBut evidence never swayed Trump before and will not now, despite his crushing defeat. Whenever he loses, he just doubles down with a bigger falsehood — in this case that a fair legal process was simply a political attack by President Joe Biden.\n“All comes out of the DOJ, it all comes out of Biden,” Trump said. “It’s a witch hunt against his political opponent, the likes of which our country has never seen.”\nThe climax of the case deepened the extraordinary legal morass facing Trump who is embroiled in multiple cases and faces the first of his criminal trials next month. The judgment portrays Trump, his adult sons and the Trump Organization, flouting business ethics, rules and laws to pull valuations for their property assets out of the air to get favorable loans, and then even more remarkably, refusing to accept the facts of their conduct when confronted with the evidence.\nPractically, Engoron’s decision will impose severe financial and personal strain on Trump as he’s emerging as the almost certain Republican presidential nominee. While Trump boasts of being a billionaire many times over, it’s unclear if he has the liquidity to pay what he owes or if some of the “beautiful buildings” and golf resorts over which he often waxes fondly in campaign speeches are at risk. An emperor has no clothes moment that reveals the ex-president as less wealthy than he claims could threaten the mogul’s mystique on which he built his political brand and his self-identity.\nWarning signs for Trump\nPerhaps most concerning for Trump, Friday’s defeat suggests the shield of impunity that has allowed his rampaging political and business career is fraying. It comes only three weeks after a jury in a defamation case in Manhattan awarded the writer E. Jean Carroll $83 million in compensatory damages for public statements he made in 2019 disparaging her and denying her rape allegations.\nWhile the ex-president’s strategy of basing his legal defenses on a political argument that he’s a victim of persecution from the Biden administration may be working in the campaign — at least for now — it is no match for the exacting standards of a court of law. At a defining moment of Trump’s fraud trial, when he was effectively making a campaign speech from the stand, Engoron asked Trump’s lawyer: “Can you control your client?” Of course, no one has ever been able to do so. But Engoron’s ruling shows that the legal system has the power to constrain Trump and impose consequences that the political system lacks, despite two impeachments and a lost presidential election. This must be a worry for Trump as he faces four criminal trials, and may partly explain his desire to win back power since presidential authority could help him block or reverse convictions – at least in federal cases.\nTrump is also absorbing a double blow from New York, the larger-than-life city and state where he built towering skyscrapers and an outrageous personality based on an all-publicity-is-good-publicity attitude to 1980s tabloids. On Thursday, another New York judge locked in March 25 as the start date for his first criminal trial — over hush money payments to a former adult film star. The next day, the real estate empire that literally changed Manhattan’s skyline was rocked by Engoron’s verdict.\nTrump has long since decamped to Florida, but Engoron’s ban on him running a New York corporation for three years will still sting. New York brashness and high stakes made Trump who he is. But his outlandishness has also repeatedly made him a Manhattan outsider. And now the city is rejecting him again, as part of a longterm trend that surely shaped Trump’s political super skill — his capacity to identify and harness the frustration of Americans who feel themselves rejected and condescended to by East Coast political, economic and media elites.\nIt’s too early to tell how Trump’s loss on Friday will affect his political campaign. The dizzying line-up of cases against him has only cemented his bond with Make American Great Again voters who bought into his expertly crafted narrative of persecution that rescued an initially lackluster 2024 election campaign and has him on the verge of capturing his third straight Republican nomination. The advantage of Trump’s sense of victimization is that every reverse further fuels it. One of his closest allies, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, therefore was able to ignore the overwhelming evidence revealed in the case of his malfeasance to declare: “The American people will not stand for this; they will elect President Trump as our 47th President of the United States.”\nBut for all of Biden’s political vulnerabilities, it’s hard to see how Trump’s increasing list of legal losses will improve his standing with the suburban moderate, swing state voters who paved the way to his loss in 2020. His remaining GOP foe Nikki Haley is making this point in her rallies. “March and April, he’s in one case court case. May and June, he’s in another,” Haley said while campaigning on Thursday ahead of the South Carolina primary. “He’s already said he’s going to spend most of this year in a courtroom, not on a campaign trail. That’s not a way you win.”\nFriday’s ruling may turn out to be another blow to Republicans in a week in which they lost a key special election in New York and the GOP House majority bolted Washington in disarray. Biden, after a rough trot dominated by questions about his age, had a better week, as Tom Suozzi’s election win cooled panic among Democrats over their 2024 prospects and after the FBI charged an ex-informant with lying, in a move that eviscerated the GOP’s impeachment inquiry against him.\nFlouted rules, new realities and a busted legal strategy\nTrump’s belief that the rules are for others defines his business and political life. It’s essential, for example, to his claim now before the Supreme Court that presidents enjoy absolute immunity and cannot be prosecuted for their actions after they leave office.\nEngoron, meanwhile, marveled at the ex-president’s audacity in flouting business ethics in inflating the values of his real estate and then his refusal to accept the truth of his actions when confronted with the evidence. “Defendants are incapable of admitting the error of their ways. Instead, they adopt a ‘See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil’ posture that the evidence belies,” he wrote. Engoron explained that such a crushing verdict was necessary to account for Trumps ill-gotten gains — because he believes they will continue in the absence of a painful price: “Donald Trump testified that, even today, he does not believe the Trump Organization needed to make any changes based on the facts that came out during this trial.”\nTrump’s willingness to create a convenient reality is also at the heart of the case filed against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James, which rested on accusations that he serially inflated the values of his holdings to obtain better terms from banks and financial firms and to ultimately make more money. The ex-president claims that there were no victims from his behavior and that everyone made money. Yet regular Americans wouldn’t get away with such conduct in their far less lucrative financial lives and investments. And Engoron argued that he was obligated to “protect the integrity of the financial marketplace and, thus, the public as a whole.”\nTrump’s propensity to simply alter truth and fact transferred easily from the business world to politics. It emerged hours into his presidency when he declared he had the biggest inaugural crowd ever despite photos proving the contrary. And his greatest fraud rests in his lies that he won the 2020 election and that the Constitution gave him the right to stay in power despite his defeat. The con-game of plucking a number out of the air to vastly over value his Trump Tower triplex is not that much different, after all, than calling Georgia election officials and asking them to “find” votes so that he could overturn Biden’s victory in the key swing state.\nIn his book, “Never Enough,” author Michael D’Antonio shows how Trump was taught by a demanding father and teachers that he needed to be “a killer” and that winning “was the only thing.” This explains his relentless willingness to fight, his never-ending legal crusades and his fervent desire at 77 years old to win back power after a humiliating election loss that nearly wrecked American democracy. Yet this refusal to ever admit defeat also appears to be leading Trump into dangerous legal territory.\nThe former president’s fight at all costs legal strategy seems to be coming unstuck. “Trump is unique in that he stubbornly thumbs his nose at our justice system and finds himself in legal turmoil,” said Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor and president of West Coast Trial Lawyers. “Sometimes it’s better to cooperate with authorities or to settle a civil lawsuit rather than fight a losing battle.”\nFor Trump, the battle itself and the act of breaking rules are the point of existence itself, even when they lead him into legal and constitutional peril. His flawed philosophy that in business and life, it’s all about closing one more deal, means that even crushing defeats like the 2020 election and his fraud trial cannot change him.\n“I don’t do it for the money. I’ve got enough, much more than I’ll ever need,” Trump wrote in “The Art of the Deal.” He added: “I do it to do it. Deals are my art form.”", "created_on": "2024-02-17T11:11:37.430Z", "tags": ""}}, {"model": "voting.vote", "pk": 1, "fields": {"user": 1, "content_type": 7, "object_id": "1", "vote": -1, "time_stamp": "2024-02-02T16:40:42.426Z"}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 1, "fields": {"hits": 1, "modified": "2024-02-07T16:32:13.545Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 14}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 2, "fields": {"hits": 2, "modified": "2024-02-16T10:54:27.886Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 12}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 3, "fields": {"hits": 1, "modified": "2024-02-07T16:32:16.551Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 13}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 4, "fields": {"hits": 1, "modified": "2024-02-07T16:32:19.718Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 11}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 5, "fields": {"hits": 1, "modified": "2024-02-08T01:31:09.560Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 10}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 6, "fields": {"hits": 2, "modified": "2024-02-17T10:45:39.229Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 9}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 7, "fields": {"hits": 2, "modified": "2024-02-17T08:13:20.519Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 8}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 8, "fields": {"hits": 1, "modified": "2024-02-07T16:32:27.810Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 7}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 9, "fields": {"hits": 2, "modified": "2024-02-17T08:08:09.846Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 6}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 10, "fields": {"hits": 1, "modified": "2024-02-07T16:32:55.752Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 5}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 11, "fields": {"hits": 2, "modified": "2024-02-17T08:09:43.714Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 4}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 12, "fields": {"hits": 1, "modified": "2024-02-07T16:32:46.517Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 3}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 13, "fields": {"hits": 1, "modified": "2024-02-07T16:32:42.075Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 2}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 14, "fields": {"hits": 2, "modified": "2024-02-17T09:34:16.785Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 1}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 15, "fields": {"hits": 68, "modified": "2024-02-07T16:32:02.654Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 15}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 16, "fields": {"hits": 2, "modified": "2024-02-17T08:01:49.309Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 16}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 17, "fields": {"hits": 2, "modified": "2024-02-16T09:24:49.342Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 17}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 18, "fields": {"hits": 2, "modified": "2024-02-17T04:43:00.268Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 18}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 19, "fields": {"hits": 2, "modified": "2024-02-17T08:00:53.217Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 19}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 20, "fields": {"hits": 1, "modified": "2024-02-10T16:32:27.801Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 20}}, {"model": "hitcount.hitcount", "pk": 21, "fields": {"hits": 1, "modified": "2024-02-14T09:54:08.912Z", "content_type": 7, "object_pk": 21}}, {"model": "hitcount.hit", "pk": 1, "fields": {"created": "2024-02-07T16:32:02.672Z", "ip": "127.0.0.1", "session": "1lny7emchfru80gkflbbna3rcuiqil9x", "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11;
